Davis-Besse,"These conditions, apparently caused by design assumptions that were not fully adequate, are being reported in accordance with 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation .or condition prohibited by the Technical Specifications, and 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as conditions that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a system needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']","['questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,The apparent cause of the HPI pump debris tolerance issues is that the original HPI pump specification did not fully consider debris entrained in the water. The concern with the original design and capability of the HPI pumps to tolerate debris are related to errors that occurred during the design and construction of the facility in the latter 1960s and early 1970s.,"['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']","['continuous learning', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"

Davis-Besse,"Therefore, the cause of the loss of taper pins in DH14B was determined to be incorrect installation of the pins by the vendor (pins installed from the wrong side) coupled with vibration induced by the flow from the April 29, 2003 test, and a lack of enhanced pin retaining mechanism (staking). The root cause of the condition was a deficient vendor manual that did not contain complete guidance for valve assembly with respect to correct pin installation.","['personal accountability', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']","['personal accountability', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The cause of the CS Pump 1 failure to start on September 17, 2003, based on investigation and industry experience, has been determined to be the false operation of the circuit breaker SST system. The SST system is believed to have inaccurately sensed and/or processed motor starting current, resulting in a false ground fault trip of the circuit breaker.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']","['personal accountability', 'questioning attitude']"
Davis-Besse,"Performance of the AFPT steam supply piping steam traps is monitored using infrared thermography on a six-month interval when the plant is operating to identify steam traps with performance problems. However, there is currently no preventive maintenance program to supplement the thermography readings. One of the degraded steam traps had last been rebuilt in April 2000; the other steam trap that was more degraded was last rebuilt in May 1995. The degradation of these steam traps was the primary cause for the inoperability of AFPT 1.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']","['leadership safety values and actions', 'problem identification and resolution']"

Davis-Besse,The primary cause of the design deficiency was less than adequate original design consideration in that the designers failed to consider the timing issues associated with the SFRCS logic gates and complete re-energization of the SFRCS 28 VDC and 48 VDC power supplies and removal of the battery-backed power supplies. This lack of consideration resulted in a condition in which the power supply energization time allowed the logic gates to energize in different configurations.,"['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']","['personal accountability', 'work processes']"
Diablo Canyon,"PG&E first identified and documented this design vulnerability in 1991 in a nonconformance report. Human error on the part of a Technical Review Group (root cause evaluation team) in 1991 to eliminate the design vulnerability was the apparent cause of this issue in that the team focused on managing the consequences of the design vulnerability rather than eliminating it (see Section VI.B, ''Previous Similar Events,"" of this licensee event report).","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution']","['continuous learning', 'personal accountability', 'problem identification and resolution']"

Diablo Canyon,"DCPP's procedure for performing 10 CFR 50.59 evaluations was insufficient because it did not provide guidance regarding TS bases changes that change the intent of the TS requirements, and that those changes may require a license amendment.","['decision making', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']",['work processes']
Diablo Canyon,"PG&E concluded that as a result of flow balancing activities, the throttling of some CRVS dampers caused the pressure in the common header to exceed the high-pressure setpoint of the system pressure switches. This configuration was not prevented because the functions of the pressure switches and CRVS interlocks had never been adequately described in DCM S-23F, resulting in inadequate design controls being established following system modification.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']",['work processes']
Diablo Canyon,1.A deficiency in DCPP's 10 CFR 50.59 procedure was identified as the apparent cause.

Diablo Canyon,The most probable apparent cause of the DCPP undervoltage relay settings not satisfying all licensing design criteria was misinterpretation of the licensing design criteria by PG&E in the 1970's (i.e. non-conservative assumptions).,"['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude']","['personal accountability', 'questioning attitude']"
Diablo Canyon,"The cause of operating in a condition prohibited by TS 3.8.1 is a non-conservative assumption leading to misinterpretation of 230 kV offsite power system licensing basis requirements in 1995, which produced incorrect operating procedures.","['decision making', 'work processes']","['personal accountability', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Diablo Canyon,"The apparent cause of this event was that the replacement TD AFW PP 1-1 speed governor was configured in accordance with the original speed governor build/testing specification. There was no documentation of internal adjustments made to the original speed governor; however, it was determined that the original speed governor had been adjusted in the past. As such, the refurbishment/replacement governor was improperly set to be a like-for-like replacement, resulting in a higher than acceptable startup speed. This condition resulted in the TD AFW PP 1-1 being inoperable during mode transition.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']","['continuous learning', 'personal accountability', 'work processes']"
Diablo Canyon,"1. The apparent cause of the loss of both trains of ABVS was a nonconforming condition in the plant ABVS design. This portion of the ABVS system did not meet the single failure criteria.
2. DCPP's licensing basis allowing ABVS manual actions, when automatic action was not available, was not clear.
3. The apparent cause for the failure to identify and correct the single failure vulnerability when preparing the design of the replacement ABVS control system was that the DCPP design change process was limited to the modification and did not search for legacy issues while performing failure modes and effects analyses.
4. The apparent cause of the Unit 2 ABVS Damper M-4A leakage past the damper actuator piston seal is presumed to be use of the seal beyond its defined service life, contrary to requirements of the DCPP preventative maintenance program for this seal. PG&E left the seal in service beyond its defined service life due to a 2007 personnel error which incorrectly closed the maintenance order to replace the seal.","['leadership safety values and actions', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']","['effective safety communication', 'leadership safety values and actions', 'personal accountability', 'problem identification and resolution']"
Diablo Canyon,"Plant personnel failed to perform an adequate risk assessment during the planning stage of the modification.

Diablo Canyon,"The cause of the events was human error enabled by inconsistent reinforcement of human performance tools on the part of Electrical Maintenance leadership.
Plant personnel involved with testing on May 26, 2011, retained an inadequate mental model of the electrical circuitry being tested. A contributing cause for this event was an inadequate procedure which lacked precise written work instructions, and did not call for the use of human performance tools and verification practices.
On May 27, 2011, electrical maintenance personnel conducted a dry run of the Unit 2 test. They connected test equipment to terminals on the Unit 1 terminal block as that was easier to access and was similar to the Unit 2 terminal block. When proceeding to conduct the actual test on Unit 2, the individual inadvertantly attached test equipment to the Unit 1 terminal block, as practiced. Lack of proceduralized use of human performace tools such as place keeping, concurrent verification practices, and operational flagging contributed to this error.","['continuous learning', 'personal accountability', 'work processes']","['continuous learning', 'leadership safety values and actions', 'personal accountability', 'work processes']"

Diablo Canyon,"PG&E performed an Apparent Cause Evaluation to determine the apparent cause for concluding that the 2005 test demonstrated no unfiltered in-leakage. The evaluation determined that human error (a mental mindset) in the interpretation of test results led to a nonconservative determination of zero leakage.
The cause of incorrectly declaring the CRVS operable was that the bases for SR 3.7.10.5 were unclear, and PG&E clarified via consulting industry experts versus requesting that NRC clarify the intent of the SR Bases.","['continuous learning', 'decision making', 'problem identification and resolution']","['continuous learning', 'decision making', 'effective safety communication', 'personal accountability']"

Diablo Canyon,"The root cause was determined to be lamp socket design. An easily
achievable torque in the socket assembly retaining nut generates a stress
in the plastic socket material exceeding its yield value. Plasticity occurs
along with creep (time dependent deformation) at the socket operating
temperature.The creep eventually leads to cracking at the top edge of the socket's thinnest section. The crack continues to grow as long as some stress
remains. The failure mechanism proceeds until either the stress is relieved by the crack opening further, or the socket breaks.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Diablo Canyon,"The root cause of the inadequate PMT was personnel error. The work planner specified the PMT based on prior experience. At the time, Eagle-
21 was relatively new, the procedural guidance was weak, and the planner did not seek input from engineering.
The cause of the late LER was also personnel error. Based on the failure
modes and effects analysis and the fact that the isolator has a very minor
contribution to the overall response time of the channel, Regulatory
Services incorrectly concluded the condition was not reportable.","['personal accountability', 'work processes']","['decision making', 'personal accountability', 'work processes']"
Diablo Canyon,"The cause of the smoke infiltration into the CRVS intake from the auxiliary

Diablo Canyon,"The root cause could not be conclusively determined due to the lack of
detailed documentation and the amount of time that had passed since the
original design and construction. The following are presumptive causes:
1. Personnel errors on the part of the original wall designers for failing to
consider the likelihood that quality-related equipment would be
supported by these walls.
2. Personnel errors on the part of the engineers who performed the wall
calculation for the Hosgri seismic event for failing to incorporate the
as-built configuration of the walls into the calculations.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']","['effective safety communication', 'personal accountability', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Diablo Canyon,"The cause of the electrical fault could not be conclusively determined but is believed to be associated with long-term degradation, and/or inadequate preventive maintenance (PM) exacerbated by a marginal design.

Diablo Canyon,"The shift foreman did not review the TS prior to directing the operators to
close the accumulator isolation valve breakers. He believed that TS

closed.","['continuous learning', 'effective safety communication', 'personal accountability', 'work processes']","['continuous learning', 'effective safety communication', 'personal accountability', 'work processes']"
Diablo Canyon,"The root cause of this event was determined to be a human error on the
part of the procedure sponsor who revised OP L-1 on February 19, 1999.
The procedure was revised to incorporate an enhancement to make use
of computerized logging of RCS temperature, pressure, and heatup rate.
While understanding that the purpose of the logging was to meet the
requirements of the surveillance, the sponsor overlooked the fact that
manual logging of the data was credited as a review of that data, whereas
automatic data collection requires review before the intent of the
surveillance requirement can be met.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']","['continuous learning', 'personal accountability', 'work processes']"

South Texas,"The causes for this event were determined to be:
1. Vendor Technical Document work instructions do not work as written when leaving the actuator installed during actuator disassembly.

South Texas,"The root cause of the event was personnel error related. Individuals involved in the technical review and approval of the ECO
failed to recognize at-risk behaviors and apply appropriate Human Performance (HU) tools. At-risk behaviors not considered
include:
Making assumptions - The Issuing Authority stopped when the individual saw ""Swap Tag"" in a note field on a line item of the
ECO revision and did not perform a detailed review of the remaining ECO line items. As a result, the Issuing Authority made a
wrong assumption that an inside containment isolation valve would remain closed.
Believing the source of information is absolutely reliable - The Technical Reviewer (new to this assignment) assumed that
ECOs would be technically sound and that the technical review would be more of a higher-level review.
Thinking the task is routine or simple - Both the Technical Reviewer and Approver of the ECO stated they viewed the ECO as
routine or simple.
Appropriate error reduction tools not used by both individuals include Questioning Attitude and Peer Review/Collaboration.","['continuous learning', 'personal accountability', 'questioning attitude']","['continuous learning', 'personal accountability', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
South Texas,"The cause of this event is that the operating crew did not have adequate technical knowledge of extended range
monitor response following a fast reactor shutdown. A contributing cause is that when faced with the situation with extended range monitor NI-0045 reading 10 cps and extended range monitor NI-0046 reading 90,000 cps, the Control Room did not initially seek input from Engineering regarding proper monitor response. Instead, the decision was made to declare NI-0045 inoperable based on the belief that 10 cps was an abnormal reading when compared to the source range monitor counts.
The most likely cause for the sluggish response of extended range monitor NI-0046 was the development of moisture
within the cabling inside the Reactor Containment Building (RCB) between the detector and the RCB inboard
penetration due to a leak in its environmental enclosure.","['continuous learning', 'effective safety communication', 'problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude']","['continuous learning', 'effective safety communication', 'leadership safety values and actions', 'problem identification and resolution']"

Diablo Canyon,"PG&E completed an ACE and determined that the cause of the failures was insufficient guidance in the work package instructions which led to an incorrect insulation configuration on the wiring associated with the RTDs. The insulation configuration as installed trapped heat inside the thermal extension piping that housed the wiring associated with the RTDs. The wires overheated inside the thermal extension piping, which caused the failures. As part of the extent of condition evaluation for the failed RTDs, it was determined that the RTDs had either failed or were operating outside the EQ temperature range.","['continuous learning', 'questioning attitude']","['continuous learning', 'questioning attitude']"

Diablo Canyon,"A. Immediate Cause Failure of electrolytic capacitors on the gate filter module and/or firing module
caused the BTCs to fail to supply adequate charging current.
B. Root Cause Failed electrolytic capacitors were identified in BTC 131, 12, 121 and 22. Two of these failures were attributed to electrolytic capacitor use beyond their service life due to replacement of printed circuit boards with aged electrolytic capacitors that were not subject to appropriate component verification prior to installation. Two failures were due to premature capacitor aging and early end-of-life failure. A BTC circuit design deficiency was identified that exposed the electrolytic capacitors to reverse voltage beyond their intended operating
conditions that reduced the service life of the capacitors.                                                                                                                                                          C. Contributory Causes

plan and schedule Electrical Bus Outages and the failure to develop and implement procedures to
provide guidance for these evolutions. The development of detailed guidance for these activities
has not been considered a station priority because the number and significance of events during
Electrical Bus Outages have been very low. In the past, Electrical Bus Outage activities have been
successfully performed using the knowledge, planning, and scheduling of the Work Window
Manager, Electrical (WWME). A contributing cause to the event is that the Senior Reactor
Operators (SROs) responsible to ensure TS compliance did not identify that removing E2C11 from
service would result in a Technical Specification 3.3.2 entry. The WWME's coworkers and peers
reviewed the Electrical Bus Outage plans provided by the WWME, however, they did not scrutinize

South Texas,"The cause of this event was due to failure to meet management expectations associated with work practices. The Shift and Unit Supervisors are ultimately responsible for maintaining the unit in compliance with Technical Specifications. In this event, neither the Shift nor the Unit Supervisor verified the equipment clearance order to ensure Technical Specification compliance due to overconfidence in the Work Start Authority's capability. The fact that the valve was already tagged to comply with Technical Specifications caused the Shift and Unit Supervisors to perceive this activity to be a low-risk evolution. In addition, the Shift and Unit Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the use of peer checks for Technical Specification compliance and no peer check for Equipment Clearance Order 9071 were performed. The Work Start Authority is a Senior Reactor Operator, knowledgeable of Technical Specification compliance requirements, responsible for the proper review and authorization of equipment clearance orders.

South Texas,"The root causes identified for this event are:
1. Perceived and actual time pressure imposed by electrical alarms and interlocks lead to a deviation from fundamental work practices. The perceived time pressure manifested itself as follows:
■ The Unit Supervisor used inappropriate communication techniques that contributed to an incorrect breaker manipulation.
■ The Unit Supervisor focused on transformer current indications, compromising his ability to provide effective oversight of the evolution. Consequently, the operator's failures to operate the synchronizing interlock switch and verify the resulting annunciator alarm were not identified or corrected.
■ The Reactor Operator did not: stop, alert others, or otherwise seek assistance upon encountering abnormal indications; verify the alarm received; or seek clarification of the Unit Supervisor's unclear verbal communications prior to acting.
2. Operation of synchronizing interlock switches were not included in plant procedures (OPOP02-AE-0002) since their operation was considered ""skill of the craft"". The omission of synchronizing interlock switches and lack of requirements to include them on 'Transferring 13.8 kV Bus Power Supply Checklist"" made OPOP02-AE-0002 less than optimum for the less practiced user.","['decision making', 'personal accountability', 'work processes']","['effective safety communication', 'leadership safety values and actions', 'personal accountability', 'problem identification and resolution']"

South Texas,"The majority of the defective tubes detected in 2RE08 were the result of ODSCC at tube-to-tube support plate intersections. This tube degradation mechanism is well known to the industry (as documented in the EPRI Steam Generator Reference Book, Chapter 12) for plants employing drilled-hole tube support plates and Alloy 600 mill annealed tubes, and has been addressed in NRC Generic Letter 95-05. It is the result of tube susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in the tube support plate crevice environment as confirmed by tube pulls at South Texas Units 1 and 2 as well as at other plants, and by the UT results from this inspection. This stress corrosion cracking has been demonstrated to be a temperature-related corrosion process such that the higher the hot leg temperature, the more rapid the corrosion progression. The 2RE08 inspection results are consistent with this understanding of the ODSCC at tube support plate corrosion phenomenon in that the lower hot leg tube support plate intersections contain the majority of the axial indications found. The root causes of ODSCC at tube-to-tube support plate intersections may be summarized as the selection of tube material (Alloy 600 mill annealed) and the design of the tube-to-tube support plate intersection locations (crevices resulting from drilled holes). A contributing factor is the high reactor coolant system hot leg temperature design values. The remaining defective tubes were plugged primarily due to OD-initiated degradation. The cause of other OD-initiated degradation (primarily axial with some volumetric) is attributed to the tube material selection, and lack of care in handling tubing during manufacturing processes. For the circumferential indications at the hot leg top of tubesheet region, tube material selection in combination with residual stresses left by the tube expansion process are the primary causes.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']","['decision making', 'problem identification and resolution', 'respectful work environment']"

South Texas,"The cause of the unexpected closure of 2C FWIV was a shorted surge suppression device in the Class-1E control circuit.
The suppression device contains four series parallel diodes and is actually a diode bridge. The diode bridge is used for surge suppression across the safety related trip solenoids. This short caused the fuse to blow in the control circuit, which de-energized the B-train safety solenoid. De-energizing the B-train solenoid dumps hydraulic fluid from the valve actuator allowing the FWIV to close.
The failed diode bridge was sent off site for a laboratory failure analysis to determine the cause of the failure. The report from the laboratory listed the cause for the diode failures as electrical overstress. The location of the melt sites on the two short circuited diodes indicate that one was most likely damaged by a reverse bias voltage transient and the other by a forward current transient. The cause for the electrical overstress cannot be determined. The control circuit was analyzed and found to be satisfactory. The diodes are rated at 10 amps and 600 volts, which is adequate for the circuit in which they are installed. The diodes are normally reverse biased at 125 volts direct current and the control circuit is fused at 3 amps. The root cause for the electrical overstress is unknown and considered to be a random failure. See Additional Information section for possible failure scenarios.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
