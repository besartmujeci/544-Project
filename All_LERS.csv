South Texas,"The root cause for main turbine governor valves failing closed was a failure of gate logic card 1A05A2 for the analog electro-hydraulic controller lamp driver card. This card failure prevented complete transfer to the impulse pressure feedback ""in"" mode and caused the reference counter to go to zero. The reference counter being at zero caused all four valves to close when turbine control was returned to the impulse pressure feedback ""out"" mode.
The root cause for automatic safety injection was partially open pressurizer spray valves. A calibration shift of the spray valve UP converters during the transient caused these valves to be driven partially open with zero (closed) demand position.

South Texas,"Root Cause:
The cause of the Train C Essential Cooling Water pump failure following overhaul maintenance was foreign material intrusion. The root cause of the foreign material intrusion was less than adequate implementation of the Foreign Material Exclusion program.
The wire cup brush threw filaments, during the normal course of use, into the inside of the inner columns (enclosing tubes). The wire brush filaments (foreign material) caused insufficient cooling/lubricating flow by blocking or obstructing the bearing flow orifices.
Foreign material prevention activities described in station procedures were not followed. No actions were taken to prevent the filaments from entering the inner columns during cleaning of the mating surfaces. No actions were taken to clean the inside of the inner columns prior to reassembly to remove the wire filaments.
Contributing Causes:
• The work package, pump maintenance procedure, and cleanness procedure, as implemented during the task, did not provide sufficient controls to prevent the introduction of foreign material.
• The craftsmen did not follow the cleanness procedure providing direction and control for preventing foreign material from entering plant equipment/systems. The cleanness procedure was not directly referenced in the pump maintenance procedure and was only listed as a source document in the work order.Work planners and Supervisors did not provide Maintenance Verification Points (MVP) in the work instructions to heighten personnel awareness to the cleanness inspection as required by the cleanness procedure.
• The performance of the cleanness inspection was inadequate. The visual inspection, as performed, could not detect the small wire filaments that were masked by the buildup of uneven scale lining the inside of the columns, poor lighting and the long length (10 feet) of the columns.

","['personal accountability', 'work processes']"
South Texas,"Root Cause:
The root cause of this event is that the,station failed to recognize the implications of the multiple material deficiencies and failure of caMponents within the Circulating Water SystemContributing Causes:
1. A:contributing cause is that the impact of using alternate materials for the stiffback was not properly recognized and incorporated into the staking process. In addition, the engineering change document requirement for the screws to be carbon steelmas not incorporated Into the vendor manual. Because the stiffback was galvanized carbon steel, theigalvanized layer chipped when staked making it more difficult to verify that the stiffback side of the stake was adequate. Because the screws were stainless steel vice the carbon steel listed in the' bill bf materials in'the engineering change documents, more force would have been required to obtain a gOOd stake than would be required with carbon steel.
2. A contributing cause is that the staking on the stiffback machine screws was not verified to have been performed in accordance with the vendor manual instructions which required that the countersunk screws be staked, by upsetting the head of the screw into the stiffback plate.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"

There are two root causes resulting in failed barriers for this event.
1. The General Electric guidelines were not interpreted correctly by South Texas Project personnel and Nuclear Logistics Inc personnel. This resulted in selection of a GE heater element one size smaller than intended.
2. The setpoint index did not include directions to use an oversized heater element for the PORV actuator motor.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
South Texas,"Root Causes for the Partial Loss Of Offsite Power:
1. The first root cause for this event is associated with the malfunction of the C phase of the Shunt Reactor Circuit Switcher that did not close. The open phase set up a current imbalance that caused currents to flow in the neutral of the Shunt Reactor and actuated the time over-current relay trip which in turn tripped the North Bus Circuit Breakers. The Circuit Switcher was inspected and tested to determine the root cause for the Circuit Switcher malfunctioning. No fault could be identified and the Circuit Switcher functioned as designed during repeated testing. Since the exact cause of the Circuit Switcher malfunctioning could not be found, this root cause is indeterminate. There are no known corrective actions relative to this Circuit Switcher that will prevent a future Circuit Switcher induced phase imbalance.
2. The second root cause is the South Texas 345 kV Shunt Reactor protective relaying scheme. The design at the time of this event allowed the Shunt Reactor neutral time over-current protective relay to trip the 345 kV Bus Circuit Breakers. A better design will have the Shunt Reactor neutral time over- current protective relay trip its circuit switcher leaving the 345 kV bus intact.
Complicating the consequences of the subject LOOP was the fact that both Units had ESF trains powered from the Unit 1 Standby Transformer.","['decision making', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"

The original design was not fault tolerant for individual power supply failures. The design description states, ""The service inlet and outlet valves are provided with lock-up devices. These valves will remain in the position held at the time of an electric failure? The ""electric failure"" portion of the design statement refers to a loss of 120 Volts AC (VAC) to the entire distribution panel for the Condensate Polishing Control Panels, and not for an individual 24 VDC Power Supply failure. The solenoid that actuates the lock-up devices receives its actuation signal from a relay powered from Power Supply #2. The lock-up devices will not perform their function of holding the CP Service Vessel Inlet and Outlet Valves In place if Power Supply #1 fails. This Is addressed by Corrective Actions 1, 5, 6, and 7.

South Texas,"The root cause is the use of Alloy 600 combined with nozzle manufacturing and installation methods that further increased the susceptibility of the metal to stress corrosion cracking when in contact with primary water.The SMAW process used to construct the J-groove welds is prone to leaving weld defects in service and creating locally high residual stresses. Metallurgical analysis of the Penetration #1 boat sample confirmed the presence of weld defects on the highly stressed interface between the Alloy 600 tube and the connection weld to the pressure vessel. Already located in high stress areas on the OD of the penetration, these weld defects act as stress risers. The sample revealed one small additional crack that connected the lack-of-fusion weld defect to the surface of the weld and primary water. Once the lack-of-fusion void became flooded with primary water, all of the requisite conditions to support stress corrosion cracking existed, as evident from the intergranular cracking around the periphery of the defect. Thus, the penetration leakage at South Texas demonstrated that the Alloy 600 BMI nozzles are susceptible to PWSCC and will crack under the right conditions.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
South Texas,"The cause of the failure was determined to be increased mechanical resistance of the breaker mechanism caused by a random build up of tolerances from wear and case distortion which our existing overhaul program did not identify, coupled with a significant reduction in latch spring rotational torque capability (6 turn spring).
In working with ABB on the root cause investigation, several differences were found between the STP 5HK and the ABB overhaul program. The most significant difference is the level of detailed inspection of individual parts of the mechanism following disassembly. The STP program relies on refurbishment using a standard overhaul parts kit. Other parts are inspected and replaced only when obvious damage is found. The ABB program inspects all parts to a very high level of detail.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"

South Texas,"he Root Cause of the degraded condition of the CRE in both Units was:
The station exhibited an inadequate, compliance-based approach to identifying and resolving CRE system health concerns.
Prior to the advent of Component Testing, the station had based its conclusions regarding the health of the CRE primarily on its ability to pass its differential pressure surveillance tests and by evidence of positive pressure across doors to adjacent areas, as indicated by smoke tests. Test results that were in some cases only marginally acceptable were not viewed with concern primarily because, despite the identified condition, the CRE continued to meet its safety function. Component Testing, first implemented in Unit 2 in early 2003 and including significantly more test points, provided the station with its first comprehensive picture of overall system condition. Unit 2 test results revealed test points at or below the acceptance criteria. Subsequent testing in Unit 1 in June 2003 resulted in all points passing (though marginally in some cases). The station placed low priority on resolving these conditions, and did not formally investigate their technical causes until after the station recognized that Component Test failures were equivalent to surveillance point failures and affected operability. In contrast, the station had aggressively resolved failures of test points formally included in the surveillance test. A more appropriate station response to these system health issues would have, at a minimum, resulted in timely restoration of failed points.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution']"

South Texas,"The cause of the event was an incorrect instantaneous magnetic breaker setting. This incorrect setting was established as part of the Class 1 E MCC Upgrade Modification, which was implemented during the spring (March 4-May 20) of 2000 during Refueling Outage 1RE09.
It was not recognized at the time the design change was prepared that the magnetic setting criterion was incorrect and should have been revised. The incorrect breaker setting data was also contained in the STP Electrical Setpoint Index. The incorrect design criteria was corrected as part of the corrective actions for a 2002 Condition Report. Additionally, corrective actions associated with a 2000 Condition Report revised several sections of the Electrical Setpoint Index to reflect the correct breaker setting criteria. However, some guidance in the STP Electrical Setpoint Index still reflects the incorrect magnetic breaker setting criteria and will be revised.
A contributing cause is the fact that the Electrical Setpoint Index in some instances provides more than one value for the breaker magnetic setting with direction to set the breaker to the minimum value and increase if required due to spurious trips. This practice masks events where the breaker is adjusted in accordance with the setpoint index because these adjustments are not reviewed by engineering and the work order closure process does not review-for these types of changes. The Setpoint Index will be revised to specify a single magnetic breaker setting for safety related SSCs.

Procedure place keeping standards for the site were less than adequate. Personnel performing surveillance test procedure OPSP03-SP-0006R inadvertently turned forward in the procedure two pages instead of one page as they had intended. In doing so, a critical test step that would have blocked a Turbine Trip signal was missed. The missed page went undetected because the site place keeping standard did not clearly define how to place keep procedure pages. Before this event, the site believed the standard for place keeping was adequate based on past successes. The vulnerability of the site to an event caused by missing a procedure page was not recognized until this event occurred.
Root Cause No. 2 (Organizational)
Supervisory Oversight of surveillance test procedure OPSP03-SP-0006R became ineffective when the SRO stepped outside of his oversight role and became involved in the process. The SRO was clearly outside of his oversight role when he was performing DV and operating equipment. Once outside of the oversight role, the SRO was no longer able to detect the error made by the test performer.

This change allowed clean, hydrazine-treated, borated water from the RHT to be used as a water source to refill the RCS during a refueling outage. In 2003, Technical Specifications 3.4.1.4.2 and 3.9.1 were revised to remove references to specific valves that were required to be secured to protect against dilution and replaced with the more generic language discussed in Section I.D above.

The relay was retained following the event, and inspected with satisfactory results. The failure could not be recreated, and the failure mode and mechanism is not known.
The causes for the event were the following:
1. Unidentified Material Condition with the failed component (i.e. relay)
2. Less than adequate questioning attitude by Electrical Maintenance Personnel
3. Less than adequate questioning attitude by Operations Personnel
The start of this event consisted of the undervoltage relay as-found operating time being outside the Technical Specification required value. After retesting, the surveillance test timing improved as observed in subsequent retests. The failed condition could not be recreated upon further testing.
The Electrical Maintenance Supervisor did not exhibit sufficient questioning attitude when consulted on this task. The relay did not exhibit the reliability to perform within limits through the next surveillance interval, and this was not recognized. Though the electricians did request clarification from the supervisor as expected, a proper questioning attitude from the supervisor would have determined that further expertise was needed to proceed. In addition, a misinterpretation of the procedure allowed the actions as performed, but the procedure intent was not maintained.
In addition, the Control Room staff displayed an inadequate questioning attitude regarding the adverse performance of the relay.

■ The Unit Supervisor used inappropriate communication techniques that contributed to an incorrect breaker manipulation.
■ The Unit Supervisor focused on transformer current indications, compromising his ability to provide effective oversight of the evolution. Consequently, the operator's failures to operate the synchronizing interlock switch and verify the resulting annunciator alarm were not identified or corrected.

South Texas,"The cause of the unexpected closure of 2C FWIV was a shorted surge suppression device in the Class-1E control circuit.
The suppression device contains four series parallel diodes and is actually a diode bridge. The diode bridge is used for surge suppression across the safety related trip solenoids. This short caused the fuse to blow in the control circuit, which de-energized the B-train safety solenoid. De-energizing the B-train solenoid dumps hydraulic fluid from the valve actuator allowing the FWIV to close.
The failed diode bridge was sent off site for a laboratory failure analysis to determine the cause of the failure. The report from the laboratory listed the cause for the diode failures as electrical overstress. The location of the melt sites on the two short circuited diodes indicate that one was most likely damaged by a reverse bias voltage transient and the other by a forward current transient. The cause for the electrical overstress cannot be determined. The control circuit was analyzed and found to be satisfactory. The diodes are rated at 10 amps and 600 volts, which is adequate for the circuit in which they are installed. The diodes are normally reverse biased at 125 volts direct current and the control circuit is fused at 3 amps. The root cause for the electrical overstress is unknown and considered to be a random failure. See Additional Information section for possible failure scenarios.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
South Texas,"1. The technical cause was a change in breaker E2D11/3A characteristics. As the breaker has aged, the time differential between opening of the breaker contacts has increased. As a result, the contact opening has become more sequential and less simultaneous. The change in breaker opening characteristics is age-related, which explains why the failure did not occur until 2002 even though the breaker has been installed since the plant was built. Conventional breaker testing is performed on one pole at a time. Such testing would not find any change in how the contacts open. This particular aging mechanism in a breaker is extremely rare. Normal aging effects both contacts equally such that there is little or no change in how the contacts open.
The increased time between opening of the breaker contacts allowed the inductive spike, created when relay K2 de-energized in charger E2D11-2, to impact the gating board in inverter 1202.
A technical contributing cause was the lack of suppression diodes across the DC relays in charger E2D11-2. Suppression diodes would have quenched the spike before it formed preventing the event. Suppression diodes are a common design practice for DC relay coils.
Another technical contributing cause is that the inverter is susceptible to DC noise causing the gating circuit to malfunction. Tripping of the inverter during charger swapping is an intermittent failure mode. The noise pulse created in the battery charger must form at a time during the inverter cycle when the gating control logic is susceptible to causing the oscillator circuit to go into saturation. When this occurs, the gate timing is extended and a simultaneous gate occurs.
2. The second cause of the reactor trip was having all four steam generator level control switches aligned to a single control channel coupled with the loss of power to instruments on that channel, thus, allowing the SG level control function to be affected by a single point failure.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution']"

The Unit 2 low pressure turbine blades have experienced blade cracking due to a design flaw with the rotor train (natural frequency modes near 120 Hz) and a faulty new generator rotor (differences between old and new rotor cause increased rotor train response). These flaws were not recognized by the vendor, Siemens-Westinghouse, due to errors in their modeling of the Turbine-Generator rotor system.
The degradation influence that caused the high cycle fatigue cracks of the L-0 blade roots is high torsional vibration at 120 Hz. High cycle fatigue is driven by high alternating stresses at the L-0 blade root area. Based on Unit 2 startup testing and investigation into the Unit 2 failures, high torsional vibrations are the cause of the alternating stresses at the L-0 blade roots. The root cause of the torsional vibration is a combination of the following:","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"

South Texas,"The root cause of the breaker failure in 13.8 KV Standby Switchgear 2H / Cubicle 1 A (SUFP 24) and the resulting Unit 2 reactor trip is that the arc failed to extinguish when the breaker opened due to moisture induced contamination shorting out the arc runner spacer between the first and second blow out coils in the upper arc chute assembly.
This caused the arc current to bypass the second coil rather than running through the coil so a magnetic field was not created in the second coil that would have driven the arc further into the arc chute.
This caused damage to the arc chutes and caused plasma (i.e., ionized air) in the cubicle. Eventually the plasma caused a conduction path in the cubicle for the three phases to ground.
The grounding of the three phases caused the voltage on the associated buses to drop to zero and resulted in an explosion (pressure wave) that caused physical damage to the cubicle.

Diablo Canyon,"The primary cause of this event was condensation (moisture) build-up inside the SUT 1-1 fuse box. PG&E believes that the excess moisture was caused by the relatively warm air in the bus ducting drawing cold atmospheric air up through a louver/filter assembly in the bottom west side of the fuse box.
When the surface salt accumulation on the east phase vertical bus bar had reached a critical level, an arc flashed along the top of the insulator between the insulator clip assembly lower bolt and the backing plate of the enclosure. The ionization and increasing heat of the air in the enclosed fuse box degraded the air's insulating properties which allowed the arc tobecome self-sustaining, resulting in a rapid pressurization of the fuse box
that caused the fuse box doors to blow open and damage the SUT 1-1 B.� fuse box.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"

No documentation could be found justifying the exclusion of the lift oil pump pressure switches, the lower bearing oil drain piping, or any other piping or component in the RCP oil system from being subjected to oil collection requirements. Drawings show the area where the lift oil pump pressure switches are located as an electrical panel. It is possible that the personnel reviewing the oil system did not realize that there was pressurized piping in this area. It is also possible that personnel felt that the probability of a leak or break at the lift oil pump pressure switches was very low since they did not provide discussion in their 10CFR50, Appendix R review that the lift oil system is normally only pressurized for approximately three minutes during startup.
The remote oil fill lines were added in 1990 to each RCP motor so that oil could be added to the lower oil reservoir of a RCP motor, if necessary, from a low- dose area during power operations. A temporary oil fill line was also installed on RCP 2-1 motor upper bearing in May 1995, due to a small leak that resulted in a low oil level alarm. This temporary oil fill line was removed during the tenth refueling outage in April 1996. All of the remote oil fill line installations were designed not to trap any oil after use. The remote oil fill lines were considered a means to facilitate maintenance and were not viewed as part of the RCP oil system, therefore they were not designed to meet the requirement that any potential oil leakage would be collected as specified by 10CFR50, Appendix R, Section III.O. These lines reduced the chance of spilling oil in an area of the RCP during oil addition while reducing dose received during power operations.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The reason that the Reactor was manually tripped is that the PZ level exceeded the procedurally specified high level limit of 290 inches when in Modes 1 and 2. The high level condition in the PZ was due to loss of letdown capability as a result of the Makeup Filters and Primary Demineralizer Filter being restricted. The filters were restricted after PD #3 was put in service. Subsequent inspection of PD #3 revealed that its internals had degraded. This resulted in demineralizer resin being transported out of the PD #3 and into the filter housings. The screen mesh that wraps around the laterals in the bottom of the demineralizer failed due to extensive pitting corrosion and material deficiencies which allowed the resin breakthrough. A metalurgical analysis conducted by Exelon Power Labs indicated that sulfur compounds, which caused a low pH, were the likely cause of the pitting. The likely source of the sulfur compounds was attributed to the degradation of the cation resin beads due to the resin's partially spent condition and extended radiation exposure to activated corrosion products.
Prior to the reactor trip, operators attempted to close MU4 from the control room. MU4 failed to fully close on this remote demand. Subsequent troubleshooting of the valve did not identify any abnormal characteristics. Therefore, the cause of the failure to close was indeterminate. During preventive maintenance tests conducted since, the valve stroked normally.
The apparent sluggish response by SP7B was evaluated. The valve's response immediately following the reactor trip was attributed to a drop in differential pressure (dP) across valve SP7B which reduced the ability of the valve to control SG level. The sluggish response of SP7B following the trip of the Auxiliary Boiler was attributed to the realignment of steam loads and not due to a tuning or hardware problem. When the steam loads were transferred, the dP across the valve was rapidly reduced. The valve went full open until the valve dP was restored.

The correct instrumentation designation, TE RC15, is cited in DB-OP-06003, Pressurizer Operation, but is not referenced in DB-OP-06903.

DBNPS Licensee Event Report (LER) 1996-008 identified the potential that if a switchyard circuit breaker should experience a lockout while an offsite transmission line is out of service, a loss of offsite power could occur. The investigation and subsequent corrective actions centered on the performance of maintenance activities causing one of the three offsite lines to be unavailable. The apparent cause of occurrence for this recent event is that the previous reviews of switchyard configuration for applicability of the TS action statements did not address the potential that opening a single switchyard breaker could result in a similar condition as having an offsite line unavailable.","['decision making', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The most probable cause of the MSSVs to have a setpoint greater than the ASME B&PV Code allowable setpoint is seat and disc galling. The initial test lift of valve SP17B7, which has a 1050 psig setpoint, was at 1093 psig. The second test lift, performed to fulfill ASME Code requirements, was at 1062 psig without any adjustments performed from the initial test lift. This high initial lift phenomenon has been identified at other nuclear power plants with Dresser 3700 series safety valves. As a result, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) initiated a project to investigate the cause of MSSVs sticking. Results of the EPRI project indicates the high lift phenomenon occurs somewhere within 30 to 90 days after installation of the safety valve and is a result of some form of sticking or galling of the seat and nozzle. The sticking or galling only occurs after maintenance is performed. Typically after one or two safety valve lifts the sticking/galling does not repeat. Evidence has shown that a gray finish on the disc to nozzle interface may reduce the potential for sticking/galling. Prior to this event, a mirror finish has been used on all DBNPS MSSVs to ensure leak tightness, and no valve lifts are performed once the MSSVs are reinstalled following maintenance. The gray finish is rougher than the mirror finish, and may help reduce galling between the seat and nozzle surfaces that occurs while the valve is inservice. A study performed by EPRI and Dresser Valve Company along with a group of utility representatives has concluded that changing the
disk material from the originally-supplied 422 stainless steel to a pre-oxidized inconel X-750 material will eliminate the high lift phenomenon following valve maintenance.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"

The apparent cause of occurrence for the failure of check valves MS145 and MS146 is misapplication of the check valves due to the original design in Modification 95-0060 being inadequate.
The design of the minimum flow piping called for throttling the flow through MS145 and MS146 with a downstream globe valve, MS 143 and MS 147 respectively, to the point where valves MS734 and MS735 stopped tapping. Throttling flow was desired to minimize the amount of steam that had to be diverted to the high pressure feedwater heater. Although the flow was throttled to stop MS734 and MS735 from tapping, the flow was not sufficient to maintain check valves MS145 and MS146 fully open. The design package for Modification 95-0060 did not include consideration for determining the minimum required flow rate to maintain check valves MS145 and MS146 in the fully open position. Although required by the valve specification, the minimum flow to hold the disc fully open was not identified on the drawing for the valve. These check valves are bolted cover, piston lift check valves, Velan Figure Number W07-2034B-02AA, with a spring opposing opening of the valve. The size of the spring in the valve did not allow the valve to be fully open with throttled flow.
Considering the location of the check valves in the piping, the check valves are subjected to turbulent flow. There was insufficient flow to keep the check valves open against the force of the spring internal to the check valve.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"

This resulted in the electrician removing the cover of a relay in the wrong side of the cabinet, touching the relay, and inadvertently actuating the relay, causing the loss of offsite power.
Test deficiencies were written during the two previous performances of the Off-Site AC Sources Bus Transfer Test in 1998 and 1996, stating that the Startup Transformer Lockout annunciator alarm cleared before the lockout was reset. The resolution of these deficiencies was that the lockout annunciator alarm performed as designed, and automatic clearing of the annunciator is normal. This information was not added to the test procedures. This resulted in the test leader requesting verification of relay status in order to investigate the cause of the unexpected alarm behavior.","['decision making', 'effective safety communication', 'personal accountability', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The first apparent cause of this event has been concluded to be inadequate work practices in that the Equipment Operator failed to close the valve MS 750 after draining the MS to AFPT 1 piping on June 1, 2000. The investigation of this event concluded that the Equipment Operator who performed the weekly drain of condensate from MS to AFPT 1 piping on June 1, was the last one to operate the valve. Valve MS 750 was apparently not closed after draining the condensate from the Main Steam piping. Though not required by procedure, the AFPT drain evolution was adversely affected by the failure to verify (self-check) the system alignment (MS 750 closed) prior to implementing further action.
The second apparent cause of this event was inadequate written communication in that there was no specific directions or procedural guidance for completion of the AFPT weekly drain evolution. Procedure DP-OP-00000, ""Conduct of Operations,"" describes the general administrative controls, which have been established for the activities of Operations Section personnel. This procedure states that an Independent Verification shall be required for all valves, breakers and other components in safety related systems where improper positioning could adversely affect system operation or containment integrity. Although the improper positioning of the AFPT drain valves could adversely affect the operation of the AFW train, there was no Independent Verification requirement or procedure controls for the weekly drain of the AFPT Steam Lines.","['personal accountability', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The apparent cause of the three MSSVs exhibiting the highest relative setpoint (SP17A4, SP17A9 and SP17B3) to have a setpoint greater than the allowable setpoint is oxide bonding. Prior to the Thirteenth Refueling Outage, all MSSVs had Type 422 martenstic stainless steel disks and Type 316 austenitic stainless nozzles. The oxides of the nozzle and disk grow together due to the similar oxide structure of the two materials. The oxide bonding is initiated by performing refurbishment (i.e., lapping) of the disk and nozzle seats and/or by installing new disks of Type 422 martensitic stainless steel. Oxidation of the disks and nozzles occurs following installation of the MSSVs in a high- temperature steam environment. These MSSVs lifted high on the first test lift and then within tolerances on the second test lift, demonstrating sticking on the initial lift. This is consistent with the oxide bonding that has been experienced throughout the industry on the initial in-service lift following disk replacement and nozzle lapping. This oxide-bonding phenomenon is documented in Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) publication TR-113560, Investigation of MSSV High First Lift Phenomenon in Dresser 3700 Series Steam Safety Valves.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"On March 8, 2002, the DBNPS management assembled a group of FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company personnel and industry experts to investigate the RPV head and CRDM nozzle condition to determine the root cause. This effort determined that:

Inadequate Settings for Pressure Regulating Valves
During original plant construction, a formal calculation supporting the design basis and appropriate actuator settings could not be iden�tified. During plant pre-operational testing, failure of the stem to actuator connection occurred because the valve stem threaded connection was undersized.
To reduce thrust forces on the valve stems, it was decided in 1977 to add a pressure regulating
valve (PRV) [CB-AFRG] between the air accumulator and the valve actuator. Based on a March 1, 1977 Field Change Authorization, the PRV for MU66A-D was set at 46 psig vice 75 psig pressure at the accumulator.

Davis-Besse,"The bottom of the reactor vessel operates at a lower temperature (approximately 558 degrees F) than the reactor vessel upper head (approximately 605 degrees F). Given this lower temperature and the duration of operation of the DBNPS, the incore nozzles would have a lower susceptibility for Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking than nozzles located on the reactor vessel upper head. At the time of original report submittal, visual inspections of these nozzles were not routinely conducted for plants in the United States, and inspections and testing at plants in France had not yet discovered any cracking or leaking of the incore nozzles. Subsequent to the original report submittal, visual inspection of the South Texas Project Unit 1 Reactor revealed evidence of leakage from two incore nozzle penetrations.
Based on the results of the Reactor Coolant System Pressure test, there was no identified leakage of the DBNPS reactor vessel incore nozzles. Therefore, this issue has no safety significance.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"A number of the conditions adverse to quality related to corrosion, pitting, and rusting of the CAC unit components and SW piping resulted from boric acid deposition. These conditions could have challenged the seismic integrity of the CAC units. The boric acid deposition was the result of leaking reactor coolant, the causes of which have been documented in the Root Cause Analysis Reports on Failure to Identify Reactor Vessel Head Degradation provided to the NRC onApril 18, 2002, and August 21, 2002. In addition, microbiological influenced corrosion (MIC) was identified on SW return flow manifold flanges following disassembly of the flanges. No evidence of prior leakage was observed.
Concerns identified relative to thermal stress and seismic design were the result of apparent non-conservative original design modeling assumptions. No basis or reference for these assumptions could be located.
Several issues were identified which related to maintenance, test, and/or configuration control activities or conditions. These conditions were either administrative in nature or did not affect the ability of the CACs to perform their design function during previous operation.
A limited number of conditions which could result in degraded thermal performance were identified. Water-side fouling of one cooling coil from CAC #3 was identified. It consisted of limited hard blockage of cooling coil tubes and accumulation of zebra mussel shells. Since the service conditions for CACs #1 and #2 are similar to CAC #3, the degraded conditions on CAC #3 are considered to be representative of the other cooling coils. The presence of microbiological organisms was attributed to lack of effective biocide treatment on the SW System prior to and during 13RFO. Air-side (cooling fin) fouling was identified as the result of boric acid deposition. The cause of this condition is described above. While conducting inspection and cleaning of CAC #2 SW piping, a piece of plywood measuring approximately 5 inches by 7 inches was discovered in the 8-inch diameter supply line upstream of the transition to two 6-inch pipes, each of which supplies SW to one of two independent cooling coil manifolds. There are no intervening pipe fittings or valves between the as- found location of the foreign material and the two 6-inch transitions. This condition is believed to be an isolated condition that occurred during 12RFO.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The cracking of the 2-2 and 2-1 HPI thermal sleeves appears to have been caused by high cyclic thermal fatigue. The thermal mixing of hot reactor coolant and the relatively low amount of cool makeup flow may have generated cyclic thermal stresses in the sleeve. Cyclic thermal stresses may have also been caused by changes in normal makeup flow. In addition to the thermal cyclic stresses which were present in each of the thermal sleeves, a contributor to the cracking could have been flow induced vibration from the RCS flow in the RCS cold leg. The end of the thermal sleeve extends into the cold leg approximately 2 inches and the flow through the cold leg could provide additional stress to an already weakening thermal sleeve which has seen thermal cyclic stress.
The current alignment of normal makeup flow is through the HPI 2-2 line, however the 2-1 HPI thermal sleeve that was installed during the 5th refueling outage was exposed to one single fuel cycle of operation as the normal makeup flow path during the 6th fuel cycle. Visual testing was performed during the 6th refueling outage with no indications of thermal stress fatigue; therefore no further tests
were conducted at that time. The thermal cyclic stress from the one cycle of operation as the normal makeup flow path could provide enough thermal cyclic stress in the sleeve along with flow induced vibration from the RCS cold leg flow for seven cycles to cause the crack identified on the 2-1 thermal sleeve. A vendor with thermal hydraulic analysis experience was consulted and it is believed that cracks could initiate as early as in their first cycle of service as a makeup flow path.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"

The apparent cause of the HPI pump debris tolerance issues is that the original HPI pump specification did not fully consider debris entrained in the water. The concern with the original design and capability of the HPI pumps to tolerate debris are related to errors that occurred during the design and construction of the facility in the latter 1960s and early 1970s. When the plant design was developed, the design of the HPI pump and the use of a hydrostatic bearing was apparently not adequately evaluated for the potential impact of post-COCA debris that was smaller than the containment
emergency sump screen openings.
A contributing cause was determined to be that the nuclear steam supply system supplier failed to consider effects of debris on internal components within the HPI pumps when questioned in the mid-1970's. The HPI pump configuration includes a ""piggyback"" arrangement to receive containment sump inventory through discharge from the LPI pumps. Subsequently, the nuclear steam supply system supplier reviewed the impact of debris in the water in the size range between 0.004 to 0.015 inches and concluded that the debris would not affect the capability of the HPI pump to successfully continue operation.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"When the DBNPS was originally designed and licensed, a LOCA analysis was performed by B&W to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.46, 'Acceptance Criteria for ECCS for Light Water Nuclear Power Reactors.' This analysis was based on the application of a May 1972 Dl. The computer codes used in this early BM were not sufficiently sophisticated to identify repressurization cycles of the type now understood to occur during very SBLOCA events. The evaluation methodologies met the standards of the time.
As a result of the accident at Three Mile Island Unit 2 in March 1979, the NRC initiated an examination of slow RCS depressurization resulting from SBLOCAs. These SBLOCAs had not previously received detailed analytical studies comparable to those devoted to large breaks. A product of this NRC re-examination was NUREG-0565, ""Generic Evaluation of Small Break Loss-Of-Coolant Accident Behavior in Babcock & Wilcox Designed 177-FA Operating Plants."" In NUREG-0565, the NRC concluded that ""the small break analysis methods used by B&W are satisfactory for the purpose of predicting trends in plant behavior following small break LOCAs and for training of reactor operators,' but concerns regarding the small break model were identified. NRC recommendations included that analysis methods should be revised and submitted for NRC approval, and plant-specific calculations using the NRC-approved model for small breaks should be submitted to show compliance with 10 CPR 50.46.In response, B&W re-examined SBLOCAs to a minimum break area of 0.01 ft2 for the raised loop design (elevated once-through steam generators (OTSO) relative to the reactor vessel) which DBNPS incorporates. The analysis of the 0.01 ft2 break predicted that repressurization cycles would occur while the HPI Pumps are aligned to the BWST but rapidly dampened after three cycles due to system heat removal dynamics. Recognizing the lower shutoff head of the DBNPS HPI Pumps. the NRC was concerned with the potential for repressurization. However, based upon mitigative actions provided by B&W, the NRC found ""the range of small breaks and small break accident cooling modes arc considered appropriate for demonstrating plant response to potential SBLOCAs.' This analysis supported establishment of a 0.01 ft2 break area as the lower limit of the spectrum of breaks analyzed for the DBNPS.
For the DBNPS Operating Cycle 13 and forward, the large and small break LOCA spectrum was reanalyzed using improved computer codes in the EM, Framatome Topical Report BAW-10192PA, July 1998. The DBNPS-specific analysis results are summarized in Framatome ANP 86-5006232-00, ""DB-1 LOCH Summary Report.' This report was issued in March 2000. This analysis included a break area of 0.01 ft2 as the lower limit of the break sizes analyzed based on the conclusion that with OTSO heat transfer available, the consequences of the small break transient decrease with decreasing break size. Revision 22 to USAR 6.3.3 discusses the evaluation results of this report. This Summary Report indicates that the repressurization phenomenon would occur during the injection mode of operation when the HPI pumps have minimum flow recirculation.

In 1991 the test methodology was changed to use cross calibration to check the RCS hot and cold leg temperature elements. However, the accuracy of the change was not verified or validated properly, and the check of the PAMS RCS hot leg temperature elements was not included in the new procedure. Since the previous procedure did not identify these temperature elements were required to be checked per the Technical Specifications, they were excluded from the procedure so that wide range temperature indication would be available during the cross calibration of the other RCS temperature elements.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"In 1987, a condition was discovered which identified insufficient controls over the configuration of the plant in that numerous components, included in vendor supplied cabinets and skids, were not included on plant drawings or in plant procedures. During the review process (1987) for this condition, it was identified that the field conditions for the CGA Hxs did not match plant documentation. Associated documents were revised to include valves CC274, CC275, CC277, and CC278 to reflect the as-built conditions of the CGAS HXs.
In February 1993 and August 1992, procedures DB-SP-03063 and DE-SP-03064, ""Component Cooling Water Train 1 Valve Verification Monthly Test"" (and Train 2, respectively), were revised to include verification that each isolation valve (CC274, CC275, CC277, and CC278) is in the open position. These Operations procedure DB-OP-01002, ""Component Operation and Verification"", provides guidance to the operator and describes the correct way to verify that a valve is open. It states: ""apply force to the handwheel in the close direction and when valve movement in the close direction is verified, re-open the valve."" The as-found condition of the valves determined that the valve handwheels Sand stem) rotated approximately one-half a turn in the close direction which indicated the valves were open. However, investigation determined that there was no flow through the valves.
Because the valve hand wheels could be moved in the closed direction, as described by procedure, this masked the fact that the valves were not in the open position. Although the valves were added to the drawings and procedures in 1990, no documentation could be found that confirmed flow through the CGA HXs after the documents were revised. Also, no records of maintenance activities could be identified that would have required the closing of these valves. Upon forcibly opening CC274, a leak was identified on the bottom of the CGA Loop 1 HX, apparently due to corrosion. This further indicated that the valves had not been opened for a significant period of time.
The investigation of the four CCW isolation valves found to be closed indicated this condition existed since original cabinet installation. The valves did not appear in plant drawings or procedures until 1990. No maintenance activities were identified that would have closed the valves. With the valves closed, the lines to the CGAs Analyzers did not completely fill with CCW, thereby creating a corrosive environment in the valve seating area. The condition of not having flow through the CGAs was not identified earlier than May 2003 because there was no direct or indirect means of verifying CCW flow through these lines. There was no attempt previous to May 2003 to measure flow through the lines. This issue of no prior flow testing was identified during the latent issues review performed on the CCW System. In order to assess the extent of this condition, the piping configuration for all CCW and Service Water cooled components was evaluated. No additional cases of piping configuration that failed to provide direct or indirect indication of cooling water flow were identified.

Davis-Besse,"As a result of the Millstone Unit 2 event in July 1976 caused by a reduction in grid voltage, undervoltage relays were installed at the DBNPS to protect the 4160 V essential buses from degraded voltage conditions. As a result of the Arkansas Nuclear One (ANO) Unit 1 event in September 1978 involving degraded voltage on the safety buses, the DBNPS Architect/Engineer analyzed the DBNPS electrical power distribution system using a computer model to ensure adequate voltage existed on the DBNPS safety buses. In 1988, the DBNPS engineering staff selected the Electrical Load Management System (ELMS) computer program to model the electrical distribution system and to perform a more detailed review of the distribution system for calculating short circuit currents and for comparison against equipment ratings, determining bus and terminal voltage throughout the system depending on source voltage and alignment, and calculating load flow within the system. However, the ELMS modeling did not include the most limiting postulated scenario of one startup transformer and one bus-tie transformer in service as had been originally modeled by the DBNPS Architect/Engineer. Although this condition appears to be an original design bases deficiency, no specific cause could be found for why the ELMS modeling did not include the most limiting scenario, which may be due in part to the fact that the ELMS modeling was completed over ten years ago. This was a missed opportunity to identify this design deficiency and is attributed to inadequacy in engineering rigor as well as inadequate management oversight in preparing the ELMS modeling and in preparing the undervoltage relay setpoint calculation, which resulted in incomplete analysis and unverified assumptions in the calculations. The issues of engineering rigor and management oversight are being addressed as part of the DBNPS Return to Service Plan.","['continuous learning', 'decision making', 'leadership safety values and actions', 'work processes']"

The events that led to the degraded grid voltage conditions in several Eastern and Midwestern states as well as Canada were outside the control and responsibility of the DBNPS. An international commission is currently investigating the cause for the degraded grid voltage conditions.
The distortion of the CAC Service Water piping expansion bellows was the result of an inadequate hydrodynamic transient analysis. The analysis used to design the CAC Service Water piping under-predicted the peak pressures that would occur for a loss of offsite power condition, when the Service Water Pump Motors would be de-energized and would subsequently restart in approximately 30 to 50 seconds, in conjunction with low Service Water System flow/high Service Water System pressure that would exist with the plant in a shutdown condition. Non-conservative hydrodynamic transient model parameters used in the analysis included Service Water System pressure, lake level, pump start times, valve alignments, and residual void volume.
The Service Water System leakage from the end bell of CCW Heat Exchanger 3 was caused by inadequate thickness dimension of the gasket material installed during the current outage. The gasket material was unable to accommodate the irregularities that existed in the gasket sealing surfaces. The inadequate gasket thickness had been identified prior to the loss of offsite power event but had not yet been repaired. The leak manifested itself because of the anticipated hydrodynamic transient that occurred as a result of the loss of power to the operating Service Water Pumps.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"

Staking is an enhanced pin retaining mechnanism that is intended to increase the stress of interference at this end of the hole as an added measure to prevent loosening of the pin.
Therefore, the cause of the loss of taper pins in DH14B was determined to be incorrect installation of the pins by the vendor (pins installed from the wrong side) coupled with vibration induced by the flow from the April 29, 2003■ test, and a lack of enhanced pin retaining mechanism (staking).

Davis-Besse,"The Containment Spray System is an engineered safety feature and is provided, in conjunction with the Containment Air Cooling System (CACS) IBK), to perform the safety function to reduce rapidly, consistent with the functioning of other associated systems, the containment pressure and temperature following a loss-of- coolant accident and maintain them at acceptably low levels. The CS System also provides an additional safety function to reduce the concentration of fission products released to the environment following postulated accidents.
The Technical Specification required number of operable Containment Air Coolers (CAW was met during this occurrence and throughout the time the plant was in Mode 3 and Mode 4 for the NOP/NOT Test. Therefore, the CAC system would have provided a means of heat removal and Containment atmosphere cleanup post-accident while in Mode 3. Also, as stated above, because CS Pump 2 remained operable, the CS System was still capable of performing its safety function with operation of CS Pump 2. The Corrective Action taken (replacing the breaker with a breaker with a different SST system) was effective as verified by at least eight successive starts without failure of CS Pump 2.
The most significant consequence of this false trip is that CS Pump 1 did not start and run upon demand (as occurred on September 5, 2003, and September 17, 2003). Between July 10, 2003 and September 17, 2003, prior to the breaker being replaced without the ground fault function (eliminating the ground fault trip function), CS Pump 1 successfully started at least six out of eight start attempts. This shows that there were successful starts of the CS Pump during this time period.
The unavailability of a CS pump has no effect on the Core Damage Frequency (CDF) because CS is not a system credited for mitigating Core Damage. CS is however, credited in the Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) for the mitigation of releases from containment and consequently the unavailability of a CS pump will increase Large Early Release Frequency (LERF).

The cause for the inability of AFW Train 1 to consistently meet response time testing requirements was excessive moisture in the steam supply piping. Poor steam quality can cause degraded turbine response time, and in the extreme, may result in an overspeed trip of the turbine.Turbine casing and trip throttle valve drains had been opened prior to the performance of the initial two time response tests, however, during the subsequent runs on September 23, 2003, the drains remained closed, causing condensate accumulation. The drains were opened to drain condensate and then closed prior to the fifth test, which demonstrated improved turbine performance. Subsequent to governor adjustments, three successful tests were performed; however, at this point steam quality had been improved via sustained flow through the turbine steam supply lines.
On September 26, 2003, after provisions were made to remove excess moisture by opening steam trap bypass valves, a significant change in the response of the turbine was observed. A graph of the pre-maintenance turbine response showed a dip in speed while increasing to rated speed and a stable rated speed was reached in approximately 25 seconds. The post-maintenance response had no corresponding dip in speed and reached a stable rated speed in approximately 20 seconds.
Performance of the AFPT steam supply piping steam traps is monitored using infrared thermography on a six-month interval when the plant is operating to identify steam traps with performance problems. However, there is currently no preventive maintenance program to supplement the thermography readings.

The apparent causes of this event were less than adequate operator performance, and less than adequate procedure guidance.
Prior to commencing the plant cooldown, simulator training and a pre-job briefing were conducted. The simulator training was conducted with Control Rod Group 1 inserted, and reactor core decay heat levels were programmed higherthan those that actually existed because the extended outage had allowed more time for core heat to decay. The actual cooldown was performed with Control Rod Group 1 withdrawn. The pre-job briefing did not include a discussion of the RPS Shutdown Bypass High Pressure trip or limiting setpoints.
Prior to RPS actuation, plant cooldown was commenced by increasing the TBV demand by about five percent over the steady state demand. The demand increase was based on the experience from the simulator training that was performed to support the cooldown evolution. However, the decay heat load programmed into the simulator was higher than the actual decay heat load of the RCS. The repositioning of the TBVs resulted in a higher than expected cooldown rate. During the transient, the operator lowered the demand signal on the TBVs but did not completely shut the valves. The higher than expected cooldown rate lowered RCS pressure and PZR level. To compensate for this system response, PZR heaters were energized, the PER level controller setpoint was increased, and demand on the TBVs was reduced. This resulted in increasing RCS pressure and ultimately an RPS actuation occurred on Shutdown Bypass High Pressure.
During the cooldown, control room operators were not specifically monitoring the highest indicated RCS pressure. The focus of operator attention was on the Safety Features Actuation System (SFAS) [41E] inputs for margin to the SPAS RCS Low Pressure trip, not the RPS. The Shift Engineer did not check the readings for the RPS pressure points to determine control margin.
Subsequent to the event, it was determined that procedure DB-OP-06903, ""Plant Shutdown and Cooldown,"" did not contain adequate guidance to aid operator knowledge of the RPS Shutdown Bypass High Pressure trip.","['continuous learning', 'decision making', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The primary cause of the design deficiency was less than adequate original design consideration in that the designers failed to consider the timing issues associated with the SFRCS logic gates and complete re-energization of the SFRCS 28 VDC and 48 VDC power supplies and removal of the battery-backed power supplies. This lack of consideration resulted in a condition in which the power supply energization time allowed the logic gates to energize in different configurations.
This design became inadequate when the original design was changed from battery-backed auctioneered power supplies for the four individual logic channels to powering channels 3 and 4 from interruptible power sources backed by EDGs. Previously, the loss of power to a logic channel would have required multiple failures of safety-related components whereas currently the loss of power to channels 3 and 4 during LOOP is a design attribute. This design inadequacy was introduced with implementation of the modification to replace the SFRCS cabinets in 1988.
In addition to the primary cause, two contributing causes were identified: less than adequate post modification testing in design consideration and work practices - inattention to detail.
A review of the modification (87-1107) to replace the SFRCS cabinets did not identify appropriate post modification testing for the re-energization issues initiated by the modification. However, it should be noted that due to the inconsistency with which the logic channels assume the blocked condition after re-energization, a post modification test may not have identified a problem with re-energization of the logic channels in a blocked condition.The ultimate responsibility for ensuring that components are properly designed for their application lies with Engineering. However, during procedure development and performance, opportunities were presented in which Maintenance and Operations personnel could and should have questioned steps with procedures which allowed the logic channels to be re-energized in a ""Blocked"" or ""Unblocked"" configuration.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"An immediate investigation response team was assembled to provide analysis on this and other issues that had recently occurred at Davis-Besse. Previously written Condition Report corrective actions that were either implemented or proposed were reviewed as part of the extent of condition. Based on the team's evaluation, the Root Causes identified were: less than adequate (implementation) work practices, and less than adequate (implementation) managerial methods.
Operations shift personnel did not consistently exhibit accountability and ownership in performing the requirements of the Work Control process, Conduct of Operations, and the Surveillance Test Program. The licensed operators assigned shift responsibilities did not have a clear owner of the 1-hour action statement associated with the inoperability of PDS-2685B.
Less than adequate managerial methods were exhibited by the Shift Manager, Shift Engineer, and Unit Supervisor. They did not consistently reinforce roles and responsibilities of shift personnel and did not hold personnel accountable to meet standards and requirements of the conduct of Operations procedure and directives on conduct of pre-job and post-job briefs. Operations management failed to address known performance deficiencies anddid not effectively implement adequate corrective actions in a timely manner. Also, Operations management failed to enforce the consequences of these actions in accordance with FENOC standards.
Contributing causes include less than adequate verbal communication and less than adequate supervisory methods.
No one in Operations supervision communicated to the I&C Supervisor/ Technician the necessity of restoring the instrument to service within one hour. The pre-job brief was found to be inadequate in that the I&C brief did not include any discussion of Technical Specification Impact times as required by the briefing checklist and the Maintenance Handbook. Also, the pre-job brief conducted in the control room by Operations did not use the briefing checklist, did not actively involve the Reactor Operators, did not include I&C personnel, had no discussion of Action time requirements, had no discussion of who was responsible for ensuring the Action time requirements were met, and had no contingency plan in place if something went wrong.
In addition, the Shift Management became distracted by other emergent TS- related activities which deterred them from ensuring that the instrument was being returned to service in a timely manner.

Davis-Besse,"Electric power to the Control Rod Drives (CRDs) and Motors [AA] is supplied by redundant power channels, and the Reactor Trip Breakers are arranged such that breaker ""A"" or ""C"" AND ""B"" or ""D"" must be open to remove power from the CRDs. When Reactor Trip Breaker ""B"" was opened as part of the surveillance test, Reactor Trip Breaker ""A"" also opened unexpectedly removing power to the CRDs allowing the Control Rods to insert into the Reactor Core.
Reactor Trip Breaker ""A"" opened due to a fuse failure in a circuit designed to open the breaker when an undervoltage condition is detected on either redundant CRD System power channel. The circuit, part of the Source Interruption Device (SID) installed in both Reactor Trip Breakers ""A"" and ""B"", receives undervoltage detection input from both redundant CRD power channels. Refer to Figure 1 for a simplified functional diagram of the CRD circuitry. The fuse in the Reactor Trip Breaker ""A"" power channel undervoltage detection input that receives power from Reactor Trip Breakers ""A"" and ""C"" had failed prior to the test, leaving the Reactor Trip Breaker ""A"" Source Interruption Device in a half-tripped condition. When Reactor Trip Breaker ""B"" was opened as intended during the test, input from Reactor Trip Breaker ""B"" supplied power channel into the Reactor Trip Breaker ""A"" Source Interruption Device also depowered, indicating an undervoltage condition. With both inputs indicating an undervoltage condition, the Source Interruption Device responded as designed, initiating a shunt trip of Reactor Trip Breaker ""A"", which resulted in a trip of the reactor due to the depowering of the remaining CRD power source.
While the Reactor Trip Breaker Source Interruption Device fuses are equipped with failed fuse indicator lights that can be observed when the Reactor Trip Breaker cubicle is opened, surveillance test procedure DB-MI-03011 contained no procedural check to determine the status of these fuses prior to test performance. The fuse in Reactor Trip Breaker ""A"" Source Interruption Device was determined to have failed due to age and fatigue.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The cause of Essential Bus D1 de-energizing was the clearing of a potential transformer fuse when the test lead contacted the potential transformer circuit, grounding the circuit. Clearing the potential transformer fuse caused the Essential Bus D1 undervoltage relays to actuate, causing the opening of the Essential Bus D1 Supply Breaker, de-powering the Bus, and starting EDG 2.
The plant was relying on a single human action (being careful) to prevent the event from occurring. Changes had not been made to remove the potential for de-powering the Essential 4160 V Buses by grounding the potential transformers during testing. Improvements in test leads were made in the past by recommending the use of test plugs and jacks instead of using test leads with alligator-style clip or mini-grabber connectors. However, due to the unavailability of shielded test plugs that would connect with the installed jacks on Essential Buses Cl and D1, shielded test plugs were not being used for routine tests.
In addition, when a trip of the Fuel Handling Ventilation System [VG] occurred in 2001 due to the use of inadequate test leads (i.e., use of alligator-style clips), the resultant recommendation was to use only shielded connectors during activities where systems needed to be maintained for nuclear or personnel safety. However, this recommendation was not fully implemented for Essential Buses Cl and D1 because the shielded type of connectors could not be acceptably configured.","['personal accountability', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The causes of this event have been determined to be: 1) less than adequate procedure DB-ME-03001 structure; and 2) less than adequate human performance (work practice errors) during performance of the surveillance test. The primary cause was determined to be a less than adequate procedure (DB­ ME-03001) in that the method of presentation/structure of the procedure is complex/cumbersome creating a human performance error-likely situation. Procedure DB-ME-03001 involves collection of over 900 pieces of data. The user is required to repetitively refer to several pages/steps during performance of the procedure because different data is recorded on different pages.
Following completion of the test, the Test Leader is required to review the data from the different pages against the applicable Acceptance Criteria. The majority of the data is verified to be acceptable by signing one signature block. Since four individuals missed the low voltage reading, the procedure structure was reviewed for human performance error-likely situations. This review concluded that the structure of DB-ME-03001 was the primary cause of this event.
A contributing cause was determined to be less than adequate human performance (work practice) for the four (4) individuals involved in completing and reviewing the DB-ME-03001 surveillance test results. These individuals did not adequately self-check/verify to ensure the intended results were correct during their recording and reviewing the December, 2003 Station Battery 2N Cell 60 float voltage Acceptance Criteria, and did not detect that the results were below the surveillance test Acceptance Criteria of 2.13 vdc.","['personal accountability', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"In 1985 Electrical Design Calculation EC-118B, ""Evaluation of Protection Provided for Containment Electrical Power Presentations,"" was performed to ascertain the degree of protection provided for electrical power penetrations. The calculation used a drawing derived from a database developed by the DBNPS architect/engineer containing electrical cables and equipment to identify the circuits requiring evaluation. In the period between 1985 and 1990, circuits were identified that did not meet the requirement to provide primary and backup fault protections as described in the plant's Safety Analysis Report. In order to resolve these issues, plant modifications were completed or the circuits were de-energized during normal operation as required. This issue was reported to the NRC via DBNPS Licensee Event Report (LER) 90-005.
The circuit providing power to lighting panel L49E1 was not identified during the original review to determine applicable circuits fed through electrical power penetrations. The database used to create drawing E-200B identified the circuit for L49E1 only as an emergency lighting circuit and did not identify the circuit with a unique Cable number. According to the database notes, it was permissible to not uniquely identify cables such as grounding, communications, cathodic protection, and lighting circuit cables. This resulted in the lighting panel cable not being listed in drawing E-200B, which was subsequently used to determine the circuits passing through electrical penetrations. The apparent cause for failing to provide appropriate backup fault protection for the L49E1 circuit is inadequate or incomplete design in that it was a misapplication to use drawing E-200B as a sole design input for the identification of applicable circuits for the evaluation.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The moisture trap system for the CGAS was historically considered below the level of design detail, as previously discussed in DBNPS Licensee Event Report (LER) 2003-005-01. The problem of components associated with vendor-supplied panels or skids not being depicted on drawings was the subject of a major investigation and configuration management efforts at the DBNPS between 1987 and 1990. Walk downs performed during this timeframe identified numerous components provided with vendor-supplied skids and cabinets that were not identified on plant drawings. The generic root cause for these components not being identified on plant drawings was determined to be insufficient control over the plant's configuration. Corrective actions taken at that time included performance of plant walk downs to identify components not depicted on drawings and changes in the processing of vendor drawings to ensure future modifications did not result in recurrence of the problem.
In 2003, after discovery of the cooling water isolation valves being closed since original installation of the CGAS, additional walk downs of the CGAS were performed as documented in DBNPS LER 2003- 005-01. During these 2003 walk downs, several less visually obvious components in the CGAS cabinet were discovered, which included the level switches within the moisture traps. Additionally, the 2003 walk downs discovered an air regulator outside of the cabinet as documented in LER 2003-005-01, possibly due to previous walk downs emphasizing only the interior of the cabinet.
The cause of Containment Hydrogen Analyzer Channel 1 failing the periodic test of the condensate moisture removal system was the unknown presence of a check valve at the outlet of the moisture trap. This check valve was similar in appearance to a pipe/tubing fitting. Channel 2 passed its functional test because the check valve at the outlet of the moisture trap was defective in that the o-ring was displaced out of its sealing area, allowing the condensate to drain. While a definitive root cause for the presence of these check valves at the outlet of the moisture traps could not be determined, the most probable cause is a lack of configuration control since the check valves may have been placed in the moisture trap outlet when configuration was not closely maintained. This probable cause is supported by the following:

Davis-Besse,"The cause of the Boric Acid Pumps not being able to meet the rate of boration specified in TS 3.1.1.1 was determined to be that the original calculation, performed in 1975 to determine the flow rate for minimum boric acid flow, used non-conservative parameters. The calculation was performed to determine the flow rate under the following conditions: a Makeup Filter differential pressure of 20 pounds per square inch (psi), a Makeup Tank pressure of 35 psi gauge, RCS Letdown flow of 45 gpm, and a Boric Acid Addition Tank level of 36 inches. While the boron concentration was not stated in the calculation, the pump flow rate of 18 gpm was used in the initial version of the Technical Specifications along with a boron concentration of 7875 ppm. The pump flow rate was increased to 25 gpm in 1994 via License Amendment 191 to allow flexibility in future core designs, but the non-conservative assumptions in the calculation were not identified.
Based upon review of historical information assembled during the investigation of this issue, a definitive root cause for this latent issue that occurred approximately 30 years ago could not be determined. The most probable causes for this event were determined to be: 1) inadequate or incomplete design aspects due to analysis deficiency, inadequate independent review of design analysis, or misapplication or interpretation of design inputs; and 2) program/process weakness in that there is no indication that standards, policies and administrative controls were available to ensure the proper rigor and consistency was applied to calculations and the design verification process during initial plant construction.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"On November 14, 2005 at approximately 1623 hours, the Equipment Operator was briefed by the Field Supervisor for CCW pump 2 pre-start checklist (procedure DB-OP-06262 Attachment 28) and breaker racking. When the Equipment Operator was briefed for performing the pre-start checklist and breaker racking operations to place CCW train 2 in standby status, the emphasis was on the breaker racking portion. The Field Supervisor discussed that one of the steps on the checklist had an ""error trap"" and that SW-37 (CCW Heat Exchanger 3 Isolation Valve) needed to be closed. This brief did not discuss that SW-38 needed to be opened nor that opening SW-38 should be considered a critical step. The operating procedure, DB-OP-06262, Attachment 28 did not have double initial blocks for performing and documenting SW-38 valve operation, which would have identified it as requiring an independent verification.
Following the pre-job brief, the Equipment Operator went on to perform the checklist. When the Equipment Operator got to the step for verifying that SW-38 was open, he began performing the verification as required by the procedure, i.e., he attempted to turn the hand wheel in the close direction. The Equipment Operator performing the verification of SW-38 position applied force to the handwheel, but he found that he could not move the valve in the close direction. He realized that the ""locking device"" (T-handle that prevents inadvertent movement of the valve handwheel) was locking the handwheel. Rather than loosening the ""locking device"" and turning the handwheel, he visually checked the position indication. This valve has a position indication that does not contain the words ""open"" or ""closed"" to indicate its position, but rather utilizes an arrow pointing to ""0"" (open) or ""C"" (closed). The SW-38 position indication arrow was blocking part of the letter and he thought that it was the ""0"" when, in fact, it was the ""C"". Therefore, the valve was and remained closed.","['personal accountability', 'problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The most probable cause of the damage to EDG 2 is the failure to torque the left lash adjustment screw lock nuts due to an inadequate level of verification. Miscommunications between the lead mechanic and the vendor representative are more than likely the initiator. Both the lead mechanic and the vendor representative are aware that the lash adjustment screw lock nuts are required to be torqued, but the vendor representative normally only tightens the lash adjustment screw lock nuts with a hand wrench. The lash adjustment screw lock nuts are normally torqued after all cylinders have had their lash set. The miscommunication may have occurred upon completion of the lash adjustment by the vendor representative communicating to the lead mechanic. The lead mechanic did not adequately verify whether the torquing of the lash adjustment screw lock nuts was completed as part of the lash adjustment, and signed off for the torquing of the lash adjustment screw lock nuts as complete when the torquing had not been performed.
The basis for declaring a probable cause is due to not being able to prove conclusively whether the lash adjustment screw lock nuts were properly torqued, or that a component failure occurred. The overall evidence indicates that the lock nuts were not torqued even though all but one of the lash adjustment screw lock nuts were tight. Subsequent analysis and inspection of the damaged EDG 2 components by the vendor identified no component manufacturing defects that contributed to this event.
Three contributing causes were identified relating to this event. The first is that the lead mechanic is expected to sign off the procedure for the work performed regardless of who performs the maintenance. The expectation is that the lead mechanic provides direction to those working on the engine, ensures the work is completed correctly, and signs the procedure to document the work performed. The diesel engine is a V-20 that has work platforms on either side of the engine, which are blocked from direct view of each other. While this dual platform configuration allows for simultaneous maintenance activities, it also increases the difficulty of one person verifying the completion of the work activities on both platforms.","['continuous learning', 'personal accountability', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The probable cause of this axial flaw indication on the 2-1/2 inch diameter Reactor Coolant Pump 1-1 cold leg drain line nozzle-to-elbow dissimilar metal butt weld is less than adequate welding process during initial plant construction in 1975. Residual stresses from extensive localized grinding and repair of a crack, slag, and a lack of penetration resulted in a flaw in this weld. There are two possibilities for the resultant axial flaw indication. Either a latent construction flaw remained from several localized weld repairs and was hidden in the weld butter by the radiograph penetrameter, or the weld repairs resulted in a crack initiation site. The residual stresses from the construction weld repairs when combined with the conducive environment of the Reactor Coolant System, plus the susceptibility of Alloy 600 material established the presence of the three key elements for the development of primary water stress corrosion cracking in spite of the low susceptibility (lower operating temperature) of the cold leg drain lines. None of the other three cold leg drain lines required a localized repair of the nozzle-to-elbow butt weld involving repetitive grinding like the Reactor Coolant Pump 1-1 cold leg drain line nozzle-to-elbow butt weld during initial plant construction.
The welding process is identified as only a probable cause since metallurgical examination of the axial flaw indication was not performed to provide validation of the cause. 
analysis of the failed piping was performed to determine a definitive cause of the piping failure. However, the piping is located directly below the steam pathway as it exits the low pressure turbine. Because of the observed complete shear of the piping and apparent lack of supports for this piping inside the condenser, the piping likely failed due to cyclic fatigue (most probable cause). This fatigue was likely the result of turbulent steam flow from the discharge of the turbine contacting the horizontal sections of the piping, resulting in piping vibration and/or deflection, and the resultant cyclic stresses eventually led to failure of the piping.
The turbine bearing waste water and oil drain piping was not included in key design documents and the system engineer was not aware that the piping existed, which allowed the situation to remain undetected for an extended period of time. Therefore, review of design information incorrectly determined that this piping was not installed at the DBNPS. This lack of information in key design documents helped create a mindset that would carry over to later Operating Experience reviews.
Review of this event identified that industry documents (Operating Experience) were published prior to the DBNPS manual reactor trip regarding failures or degradation of turbine bearing waste water and oil drain piping. While some of these piping failures were attributed to erosion/corrosion of the piping, others were similar to the DBNPS event where the piping failed suddenly, resulting in a rapid plant shutdown and/or trip. This event may have been prevented had a more rigorous review of industry experience been performed, which may have led to the identification that similar drain piping was installed at the DBNPS.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"A problem Solving and Decision Making team was convened, and the investigation determined that the cause of the high condenser pressure was due to air in-leakage from a broken Low Pressure Turbine Bearing Waste Water and Oil Drain pipe [TF-DRN]. The purpose of this drain pipe (also referred to as a ""slop"" drain) is to collect any oil and waste water from around the low pressure turbine bearings and route this waste to a common collection sump. Four of these 1'/2 inch drain lines exist, one for each Low Pressure Turbine Bearing. Because of the location of the catch basin, the drain lines are each routed through the Condenser. These drain lines are designed to remove water or oil that may accumulate due to mis-operation or malfunction of the turbine steam seal or lubricating oil system and/or spillage and seepage that may occur during maintenance outages. An additional purpose of these drain lines is to provide a means to collect and retain turbine bearing lube oil in the event of a catastrophic or chronic bearing oil leak. However, during normal operations, these drain lines have no flow.
Inspection of the Low Pressure Turbine 1-1 bearing number 4 drain piping at the condenser outlet via boroscope revealed the piping experienced a complete shear a few inches inside the condenser. The failed drain piping was plugged/capped at both ends via a Temporary Modification. A stabilizing pipe was also inserted to ensure the piping was supported to prevent potential damage to the condenser internals during the balance of the operating cycle. Condenser pressures returned to normal following plugging/capping of the drain piping, and the plant was returned to power operations.

The probable cause of the LVSGR and CCW Room ventilation dampers/louvers not being able to withstand design basis tornado induced differential pressures is a less than adequate initial design in that the ventilation dampers were never considered as being subject to tornado differential pressure loading, and therefore were under-designed. Evaluation of this issue found no information that addressed tornado differential pressure for dampers, ductwork, or the ventilation systems. The focus on protecting the plant from natural phenomenon appeared to have been placed only on the plant's structures, The construction design specification, issued in 1972, did not address tornado differential pressures. Due to the age of this specification, no information was obtained on how the specification was developed.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The Radiation Monitor optical isolation boards are input/output cards that provide electrical separation between the microprocessor and its input and output signals. Through these boards, external monitor status bits are read and made available to the CPU. Also, control bits are transferred from the CPU to external devices such as relays or solenoids. Although the boards were tested at the vendor facility using DBNPS software, the boards would not function as desired when installed in the system. The new optical isolation board installed for the iodine channel on October 15, 2007, resulted in repositioning of three valves to their bypass positions, rendering monitor RE4598BA inoperable.
When the optical isolation boards were replaced and RE4598BA was returned to service on October 16, 2007, inadequate Post Maintenance Testing of the circuit function was performed. The Post Maintenance Test Manual does not include additional requirements for testing the unique functions associated with the radiation monitor electronic isolator and relay boards.
Procedure DB-SC-03218, ""Quarterly Functional Test of RE4598BA, Station Vent Normal Range Radiation Monitor"" (Revision 07), did not adequately test the system to validate that it was capable of performing its designated function. When the normal range monitor is in the bypass mode, the three radiation detector channels do not see flow and cannot sense increasing Station Vent radiation levels. A separate verification of the required flow path was not considered necessary due to the perception that it was verified indirectly using the low flow check and by observing normal flow through the monitor on available indicators.
A contributing cause to the events was less than adequate work practices in that the Shift Senior Reactor Operators (SROs) did not thoroughly challenge assumptions and unexpected conditions, or confirm details when uncertainty existed. The mindset that the low flow condition was limited to a sampling problem was non-conservative and influenced follow-up decisions that could have identified the condition that RE4598BA was in bypass and inoperable before releasing the opposite train monitor for work.","['personal accountability', 'problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"On October 29, 2007, with the plant in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power, Decay Heat Removal Train 1 was declared inoperable in order to perform scheduled maintenance. The train was safety tagged and the piping drained under a clearance per procedure NOP-OP-1001, Clearance and Tagging Program. The piping downstream of valve DH1B, Decay Heat Removal Pump 1 Discharge to the Reactor Coolant System (a Containment Isolation Valve), did not need to be drained for the maintenance activities and was kept full of water by closing DH1B prior to draining the system.
Following work completion and removal of the safety clearance, the train was filled and vented on October 31, 2007, in accordance with the system operating procedure (DB-OP-06012 Revision 29) and an Operations Evolution Order developed to provide instructions for pump restoration. Venting from valves DH177/DH177A, Decay Heat Removal Pump 1 Discharge to Reactor Coolant System Vent, was marked as being not applicable in the system operating procedure because Containment was inaccessible, and because DH1B was closed prior to the start of Decay Heat Removal Train 1 draining.
Neither the system operating procedure section for filling and venting Decay Heat Removal Train 1 following maintenance in Modes 1 to 3 nor the Operations Evolution Order contained instructions to vent from DH73, Decay Heat Pump 1 Discharge Line Leak Test Connection Valve, which was the high point of piping drained during the train outage. DH73 is located at elevation 567'-0"" and venting from this location would have ensured the train was water solid to the upstream side of DH1B.
The cause of this event was determined to be inadequate procedural guidance for recovering the Decay Heat Removal System following on-line maintenance. The system operating procedure DB-OP- 06012 contains sections for starting, operating and recovering the system in all phases of system operation. Included are sections 4.39 and 4.40 for filling and venting the Decay Heat Removal Trains following maintenance during Modes 1 to 3. The guidance of these two sections is focused on recovering from maintenance to the Decay Heat Removal Pump and Cooler, and they do not take into account that maintenance may have been performed on some system piping sections downstream of the cooler, and that these piping sections need to be vented prior to returning the system to operable status.","['decision making', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The axial flaw was located in the alloy 82/182 portion of the dissimilar metal weld. The thickness of the alloy 82/182 portion of the dissimilar metal weld is approximately 1.25 inches. The Decay Heat Removal Drop Line had been in service for 19.25 effective full power years (EFPY) at a temperature of 606.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
The probable cause of the axial flaw in the hot leg to decay heat removal nozzle dissimilar metal butt weld was determined to be the result of PWSCC that resulted in the axial flaw progressing through-wall, and resulted with water seeping during the application of the structural weld overlay. The stress corrosion failure mode is supported by ultrasonic examination results which confirm a similar profile and characteristics to stress corrosion cracking at other plants established by metallurgical examination.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The cause of the Potter and Brumfield MDR 4121 rotary relays to fail in mid-position was a misapplication of the relays. These relays were not designed to have the coil wired through its own contacts, and in doing so, in some instances the contacts can de-energize the coil before the relay has completely moved the contacts to the spring holding position. This causes all the relay contacts to remain open and not in the desired state. The relay manufacturer makes other relays that are specifically designed to use its own contacts to set or reset the latch and unlatch coils, and the physical point gap of the contact is manufactured to allow the correct timing of the device.
When NRC Information Notice 92-19 was issued in 1992 to describe this issue with the Potter and Brumfield MDR rotary relays, there were no MDR relays used at the DBNPS. In 1999, the MDR relays were identified as a replacement for Westinghouse Latching Type AR relays for which the mechanical latch attachments had been discontinued and the magnetic replacements were not seismically qualified. The Potter and Brumfield MDR rotary relays were installed in the CAC fan circuits in 2000 and 2001. Due to an inadequate design change, the operating experience with the Potter and Brumfield MDR rotary relays was not effectively used to prevent the problems identified.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"In 2002, the two temperature elements (TESP15A and TESP15B) [10-TE] providing indication of the steam temperature at the inlet to the high pressure turbine were replaced with new Rosemount series 0078 Platinum Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs) along with matched transmitters to provide a greater accuracy than the previously installed RTDs. This replacement was done as part of the modification to install a Leading Edge Flow Meter and improve the accuracy of the plant power calorimetric measurement to allow an increase of 1.63 percent rated thermal power. The changes to the Operating License and Technical Specifications for this 1.63 percent rated thermal power increase were approved by the NRC on June 30, 2008 and plant power was increased accordingly on July 14, 2008.
The Rosemount series 0078 RTD is a wire wound device with a resistance that changes as a function of temperature. The wire coil is encapsulated in a spring loaded sensor assembly, and the sensor is installed in a thermowell with the tip compressed against the end of the thermowell via a spring to provide an accurate measurement of the temperature along with a faster response time and better vibration resistance.
The RTD providing the erroneous indication (TESP15A) was removed from the system and sent for failure analysis, which determined that the temperature element had been damaged by vibration, resulting in the output shifting low. The Main Steam piping where the temperature element is installed is subject to constant vibration while the plant is in operation. The damage was caused by the piping vibration in conjunction with the incorrect length of the RTD. The RTD is approximately the same length as the thermowell in which it is installed. However, the RTD should be approximately 0.5 inches longer than the thermowell to ensure proper compression of the sensing element. Without the proper compression, additional movement of the RTD in the thermowell is likely, contributing to the vibration­ induced failure. The RTDs installed in 2002 were the same length as the originally installed RTDs, so the short RTD length appears to be a latent error from original plant construction. The original Rosemount 104AFP RTDs (installed prior to 2002) were less accurate than the new RTDs but appear to have been much more rugged, so the length of the thermowell and vibration did not adversely affect their operation.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"Following the DBNPS June 9, 1985, Loss of Feedwater Event (Reference LER 85-013), the SFRCS was re-designed, which included a complete replacement of the SFRCS cabinets in 1998. The condition identified above was introduced as part of the design and implemented with the replacement of the SFRCS cabinets during that 1988 time period.
The root cause of the event is less than adequate time allowed for development of the modification that re-designed the SFRCS in that the schedule for implementing the modification was accelerated. The original design specification for SFRCS issued included a requirement for auctioneered power supplies. It was determined by Management personnel to accelerate the outage schedule in order to return the Unit to service. As a result of the accelerated schedule, the original design of the SFRCS system was not installed.

Davis-Besse,"The direct cause of the unacceptable CRDM nozzle and J-groove weld flaws with RCS pressure boundary leakage is primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) that resulted in flaws propagating through the CRDM nozzle or through the length of the weld with boric acid leakage onto the reactor vessel closure head. This cause is supported by an ink:la-dent technical review of the UT examinations, destructive examinations of samples from two CRDM nozzles, and aligns with industry experience for reactor vessel closure heads and CRDM nozzles constructed of Alloy 600 material. The DBNPS reactor vessel closure head was replaced due to the discovery of degradation as documented in DBNPS Licensee Event Report 2002-002. The current DBNPS reactor vessel closure head, which was purchased from the cancelled Midland Unit #2 and placed in service in September 2003, has been in service for three operating cycles. No.RCS pressure boundary leakage had been identified during previous bare metal visual examinations of this RVCH.
Operating temperatures of the DBNPS RVCH were previously considered to be equal to the highest RCS hot leg temperature at approximately 606.4°F. Analysis performed following discovery of RCS pressure boundary leakage on March 13, 2010, determined the temperature of the water circulating thrbugh the upper region of the RVCH is approximately seven to eight degrees warmer than previously understood. This is due to channeling of warmer water leaving fuel assemblies located below the control rod guide tubes to the RVCH. The core fuel design determines the fuel assemblies' power and subsequent water exit temperature. The RVCH temperature is used to calculate Effective Degradation Years and Re-Inspection Years, which are used in the calculation to determine when the next inspection is required to be performed per regulations.
The Root Cause of the CRDM nozzle cracking and J-groove weld flaws with RCS pressure boundary leakage was a less than adequate perception of the risk of PWSCC susceptibility with the replacement RVCH resulting in inadequate identification, development, and implementation of interim actions to mitigate degradation prior to replacement with a PWSCC resistant Alloy 690 RVCH.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"

The root cause of this event is a lack of program implementation by the site organizations for DC ground hunting. No organization had advocated ownership for the process of DC ground hunting or reinforced expectations for the prioritization and resolution of DC system grounds, and there was not a clear ownership for the process of DC ground hunting. This resulted in a mindset for all organizations to inadequately prioritize DC ground indications.
The direct cause of Auxiliary Feedwater Train 2 being inoperable for longer than allowed per the TS Limiting Condition of Operation was the existence of a hard ground on DC motor control center 2 due to the main transformer oil pump flow indicating switch for cooler #3 being stuck in the closed position resulting in the failed AFW discharge control solenoid valve (FV6451). This ground fault, which existed for approximately 18 days, induced a voltage greater than the design capacity of the position controller","['effective safety communication', 'leadership safety values and actions', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"

The root cause for fuel assemblies being located in the spent fuel pool in a pattern prohibited by the Technical Specifications is less than adequate assessment of the risks and consequences when making changes in the guidance for describing acceptable analyzed fuel assembly storage patterns in support of the SFP re-rack project LAR. Relocating specific spent fuel pool loading pattern restrictions from the TS to administrative procedures eventually allowed other pertinent information to be eliminated from the TS Bases without the risks and consequences of the change to be realized.
A contributing cause for fuel assemblies located in the spent fuel pool in a pattern prohibited by the Technical Specifications is less than adequate accountability for literal compliance with Technical Specifications.

The CAC outlet temperature control valves are unusual in that they are fail-open air-operated Containment Isolation valves. In addition, the temperature control valves are interlocked with the CAC fan motors that operate in multiple speeds with complicated logic schemes (including multiple inputs from the SFAS). The control logic for the CAC 3 outlet temperature control valve is further complicated by the fact that it can be powered from either train of electrical power.
The root cause of this event was that the elementary wiring diagram used to prepare the clearance did not reference an additional drawing to inform the reviewer of breaker contacts that impact the power supply to the CAC 3 Outlet Temperature Control Valve controls. The clearance preparer and reviewer failed to identify this breaker interlock, resulting in the CAC 3 Outlet Temperature Control Valve being rendered inoperable when the clearance was revised on November 30, 2010. The valve remained inoperable until discovered on January 22, 2011, during routine testing.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The root cause for the momentary reductions in the control signals to the Auxiliary Feedwater Pump and Motor-Driven Feedwater Pump discharge valves was the station decision in 1991 to remove the specific requirement that had been put in place to exclude radio usage in the vicinity of the Auxiliary Shutdown Panel. The basis behind this inadequate station decision was not documented. The decision resulted in the Auxiliary Shutdown Panel not being labeled as a radio restricted area; thus allowing the use of radios within the vicinity of the Auxiliary Shutdown Panel.
A contributing cause is the lack of content and knowledge of procedure, DB-OP-06441, Radio Communication System. This procedure does not list the area in the vicinity of the Auxiliary Shutdown Panel (within 6 feet) as a radio restricted area when the cabinet doors are open and only provides a general recommendation for radio users to be advised not to operate their radios within two feet of plant electrical and electronic equipment. The maintenance personnel involved in the fire detection test were not aware of this procedure.","['decision making', 'effective safety communication', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The plant's design basis is that non-safety related electrical equipment, whose failure under postulated environmental conditions could prevent satisfactory accomplishment of the specified safety-related electrical equipment required safety functions, is qualified as required. However, as stated previously, the RCP backup oil lift pump motors and an emergency supply to a Containment Lighting Panel are located inside containment and are not environmentally qualified. This condition has existed since the original design of the DC System DBNPS in the 1970s. The apparent cause for the inadequate design of the DC System with respect to electrical separation is a lack of analysis and/or documentation to support multiple high impedance faults on safety-related components induced by harsh environments, and their impact on safety-related components.
The automatic transfer switches were installed in the early 1980s in response to NRC Bulletin 79-27, ""Loss of Non-Class-1-E Instrumentation and Control Power System Bus During Operation."" The intent of Bulletin 79-27 was to ensure that the loss of power to any bus in the plant electric distribution system would not result in control system actions that would cause a plant upset or transient condition requiring operator action concurrent with the loss of control room information upon which these actions would be based. The apparent cause of this issue is also inadequate design analysis in that the requirements of Safety Guide 6 were not addressed during the modification process that installed these switches, and may have been overlooked altogether during the design reviews.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"

On May 19, 2012, personnel in the Outage Control Center (OCC) heard reports that battery testing was field complete and that the battery met the test acceptance criteria; however, there was still paperwork to review.

Personnel knew the DC distribution trains were cross-tied to one power source, but did not realize that during fuel handling activities the cross-tie provided the Loss of Power Start function for the Operable EDG 1.

The most probable cause of the seal cavity vent line to elbow socket weld failure was high cycle fatigue. This high cycle fatigue was believed to be due to a less than adequate design modification to minimize vibration in combination with a discontinuity in the socket weld root. Metallurgical testing and examination is required to confirm or disprove this cause of the weld failure. However, repair of the weld involved grinding out the weld indication and performing a weld repair of the removed material. As such, metallurgical testing and evaluation of the failed weld was not possible to confirm this failure mode. Industry operating experience indicates the majority of socket weld failures occur due to high cycle fatigue, and piping vibrations were measured during RCP operation to support this most probable cause.
The existing seal line vent configuration for RCP 1-2 has existed since 1990, when the piping was lengthened by approximately five inches to accept a new style of RCP seal. The piping modification performed at that time did not appear to consider the impact of changing the vent line piping to accommodate the new seals would have on the socket-welded pipe. Small changes to small bore piping can affect the piping resonance frequency, resulting in higher amplitude vibrations, potentially resulting in a high-cycle fatigue failure.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The RCP motor trip was caused by a failure of terminal block screws and CT wiring degradation. The CT wiring was found with two areas of damage caused by corona discharge from the 13.8 KV buss bar. The damage occurred where the CT wiring was touching the high voltage buss bar insulation in the RCP Motor 1-2 termination box. The wiring and the terminal block and screws had been installed approximately three years prior to the event in 2010. The wiring appears to have been installed in the same manner as the original CT wiring. However, the replacement wiring was more flexible than the original wiring which may have allowed the wiring to move during RCP operation due to vibration or due to changing magnetic fields when starting the RCP. The degradation occurred after the wire moved such that it touched the buss bar insulation.
The 2010 replacement terminal block screws degraded and failed due to stress and cycle fatigue. The terminal block is located in a hot, moist environment and is subject to vibration from the RCP motor. The originally installed screws, replaced in 2010, had lasted over 30 years and not failed. The replacement screws were likely substandard and would not have met the requirements of the originally installed equipment. The replacement terminal block and screws were purchased commercial grade. The material was not checked to ensure the terminal block screws would meet the applicable standards for quality or the application where the screws were used.","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"

Davis-Besse,"The direct cause of the CRDM 4-3 high temperature was the inadvertent disengagement of the cooling line quick disconnect fitting while moving the flexible hoses to provide clearance for replacement of the CRDM 7-4 Position Indication Tube. This was due to the Position Indication Tube replacement activity being conducted without completely identifying and assessing all risks and consequences. The work was performed by FENOC workers who had not previously performed the task, with the Integrated Head Assembly on the Reactor Vessel at normal operating temperature and pressure, all CRDM cooling lines connected and in service, while simultaneously performing Control Rod surveillance testing. Replacement of the Position Indication Tubes is typically performed by outside contractors with the unit shut down, the cooling lines disconnected, and the Integrated Head Assembly removed from the Reactor Vessel. The workers were briefed for personnel safety issues including heat stress and personal protective equipment, radiological conditions, foreign material exclusion, and proper work document adherence, and received training on an equipment mock-up prior to actual work performance.

Davis-Besse,"A direct cause of Mechanical Penetration Room 4 Door 308 failure to latch was a design flaw that could cause the mortise/latch fingers to stick, preventing the door from opening and closing as required. This design flaw was not identified during the original testing of the commercial mortise/latch due to inadequate testing by the vendor of the original style mortise/latch. The vendor had a modified version of the mortise/latch body to correct the problem available, but not yet in full production.
A second direct cause of Door 308 failure to properly open and close is that the door closer stuck in the partially open position. The door closer for Door 308 was an adjustable, one size fits all, door closer that was not properly sized for the application. While the closer may have been the strongest available from the vendor and the best available model at the time of selection, it did not have sufficient strength to close the door against the normal forces placed on the door by ventilation or to prevent the door from slamming closed during off normal ventilation conditions. The selection of the door closer is a latent design issue potentially going back to original plant design.
The root cause of Door 308 failing to close was that effective corrective actions were not taken to correct door failures. The door closer had been replaced numerous times with like for like components, and issues with the door not closing properly had been experienced for more than 10 years and possibly since original installation without taking adequate corrective actions.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"

Davis-Besse,"During initial plant licensing, the DBNPS Preliminary Safety Analysis Report stated the BWST could be aligned to the SFP System for purification. The initial system operating procedure for the SFP Cooling and Purification System included instructions to align the BWST for purification, and did not reference the BWST TS. Personnel did not recognize that aligning a seismic system to a non-seismic system could affect the operability of the BWST as specified by the TS. This alignment was used in the early 1980's while the plant was in Modes 5 and 6 in conformance with the TS. In 1988, the operating procedures for the BWST and SFP Cooling and Purification System were combined into one procedure, and during the consolidation references to the applicable TS were removed.
In 1991, the BWST was aligned to the SFP purification with the plant in Mode 1, and since that time the BWST has been consistently aligned to the SFP Purification System for a few weeks before and after refueling outages to purify the BWST water.
In 2010, an industry Operating Experience (OE) was issued describing a similar condition at another facility where the purification of a borated water source in Modes 1 through 4 via a non- seismic system rendered the water source inoperable. The evaluation of this industry OE - concluded the BWST remained Operable when aligned to the SFP Cooling and Cleanup System because the BWST is not required to mitigate a seismic event per the DBNPS design basis. The Operability requirements of the BWST per TS 3.5.4 were not addressed in the OE evaluation. Review of additional OE related to this issue, including NRC Information Notice (IN) 2012-01, failed to recognize the established industry and NRC position that alignment of the seismic BWST to a non-seismic purification system rendered the BWST Inoperable during Modes 1 through 4.
The cause of the seismic BWST being aligned to the non-seismic SFP Purification system in Modes 1 through 4, therefore rendering the BWST inoperable, was due to misinterpretation of the operability requirements of the BWST during the original design phase of the DBNPS. Contributing to this event is that Operating Experience evaluations failed to recognize established NRC positions, and the expectations of Supervision/Management regarding Information Notices or NRC positions in other OEs were not defined.","['continuous learning', 'decision making', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The Root Cause process is designed to methodically process an event through a structured investigation system to identify causal factors, failed barriers, and root and contributing causes. Proper implementation of Root Cause methodologies will generally drive the investigation to evaluate latent organizational weaknesses or drivers and safety culture issues. By performing the Root Cause evaluation on a perceived cause of the 2006 event verses the terminal event, the investigation overlooked program implementation details that were crucial to establishing effective corrective actions. The Root Cause was determined to be the failure to establish a proper level of verification to ensure the quality of an engineering tool commensurate with ensuring safety, and the preventive action for this cause was to perform an independent horizontal review of the modeling data. This preventive action was to be implemented as part of a vendor project to convert the FAC software to the latest version. Since the Root Cause evaluation was focused on identifying organizational and programmatic issues, it did not investigate the fundamentals of the FAC software project to identify that the software conversion project did not include validating all data inputs.","['continuous learning', 'leadership safety values and actions', 'problem identification and resolution']"

The root cause of breaker BF1277 being inadvertently bumped is that station management did not fully recognize the risk of not protecting the breaker from being mispositioned. The fleet has a component control program that utilizes a graded approach for establishing a bumping prevention / mitigation plan, which considers the probability of a bumping incident in addition to the immediate consequences of a change in position.

Davis-Besse,"weakening due to initial in-rush current; both of which can result in fuse failure during normal operations.
The second direct cause of the reactor trip was continued plant operation with RPS Channel 1 inoperable due to the failure of temperature element TERC3B2 monitoring RCS Loop 1 Hot Leg Narrow Range Temperature. Operating with RPS Channel 1 inoperable requires placing the channel in bypass and tripping the channel when it is required to be removed from bypass. RPS Channel 1 was removed from bypass and placed in trip status on January 29, 2016 to allow performance of NI calibrations in the other 3 channels of • RPS. When Fuse Y414 failed, the 2 of 4 trip logic for RPS was completed, and the reactor trip was initiated.
A contributing cause to the reactor trip was a deficient trend evaluation of failures of the A25X series fuse, such as was installed in Y414. Preventive Maintenance (PM) activities were created with a 15-year periodicity to replace the A25X10 (10 amp) and A25X15 (15 amp) fuses. Spurious failures of these fuses continued to occur following these periodic replacements. However, evaluation of the trend did not recognize that the PM frequency was not adequate to prevent failures.
The first direct cause of the failure of the ICS to properly respond to the reactor trip was due to the failure o,f the RFR circuitry to actuate, which was due to an ICS module not being properly wired for the installed application. In 1990, an ICS module that was used as the Borate Control Switch was removed by a modification and sent to the warehouse for later use. During the most recent refueling outage in 2014, this ICS module was obtained from the warehouse and installed in the ICS functional location for the RFR Defeat Switch. Because the module wiring was not properly wired for this installation, the RFR Defeat Switch prevented the RFR circuitry from actuating even though it was in the ON position.
The second direct cause of the failure of the ICS to properly respond to the reactor trip was due to the Steam Generator/Reactor Demand Hand/Auto,station transferring to Hand following the trip of the Main Turbine. If the ICS station would have remained in automatic, it would have reduced feedwater demand quickly enough to prevent reaching the SFRCS high level trip setpoint. The cause of the Hand/Auto station transferring to hand was an ineffective software change. Changes were made to the ICS during the 2014 refueling outage to improve control of the Unit Load Demand circuitry. However, these changes inadvertently introduced a new failure mode that caused the Hand/Auto station to transfer to hand whenever a large and rapid change in generated megawatts occurred, such as would occur during a reactor or turbine trip. This failure mode was identified while performing training scenarios on the simulator following the 2014 refueling outage, but the software change made in December 2015 to correct the failure mode was not successful.
The first root cause of the failure of the ICS to properly respond to the reactor trip was due to inadequate work package instructions for performing a bench check of the replacement ICS module, as they did not ensure the bench check adequately tested the module's intended function. A continuity check was performed followed by toggling the switch on and off ten times and then rechecking continuity to ensure the switch resistance had not increased. However, the bench check did not validate the switch position with the contact state of the output pins per the vendor manual or ICS drawing, and therefore did not verify the RFR switch was properly wired for the toggle ON position.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"The direct cause of the event was insufficient pressure in the piping upstream of the MFW to SG 1 Check valve (FW147), resulting in the SFRCS Actuation. When MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612) was opening, the downstream SG pressure of approximately 870 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) was immediately applied to the downstream side of MFW to SG 1 Check Valve (FW147), developing greater than 125 pounds per square inch differential (psid) reverse DP, thus causing the SFRCS SG 1 High Reverse DP trip. The unexpected SFRCS SG 1 High Reverse D/P trip resulted in the reclosure of affected valves, including the MFW Isolation Valves, as designed. The AFW Pumps remained in operation, as expected. The MDFP remained operating aligned to the MFW Header and continued to pressurize the piping between the FW Heaters up to the MFW Isolation Valves.
The apparent cause of the event is that less than adequate procedural guidance is contained in procedure DB-OP-06910, Trip Recovery. The guidance in this procedure was inadequate to ensure that the MFW piping segment between MFW Bypass Throttle Valve (FW139) and MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612) was sufficiently pressurized prior to opening MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612).","['problem identification and resolution', 'questioning attitude', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,"A laboratory failure examination was unable to confirm the pressure boundary leak path, but a partial depth weld solidification crack was observed in the Alloy 625 pressure boundary material at the hose / bellows tube to socket end. A similar through-wall weld solidification crack at the flange to hose / bellows tube pressure boundary weld was likely the source for the boric acid leakage for the RCP 1-1 first stage seal cavity vent line. Therefore, the direct cause of the RCP 1-1, first stage seal cavity vent line pressure boundary leakage was likely a weld solidification crack during manufacture. Each of the other identified failure modes from operation, installation, manufacture, and design were refuted.
The DBNPS had three (3) uninstalled spare flexible hose assemblies also supplied in the same batch as the leaking hose for the RCP 1-1 first stage seal cavity vent line. These spare hose assemblies were subsequently bubble tested (30 psig air pressure for 10 minutes) and helium tracer probe leak tested. All three (3) uninstalled spare flexible hose assemblies passed the bubble test, but one (1) failed the helium tracer probe leak test acceptance criteria. Helium tracer probe leak testing of the uninstalled spare hose assemblies permits increased sensitivity for detection of extremely small leaks. Helium tracer probe leak testing was proven an effective barrier that could have mitigated or prevented shipment of the flexible hose assembly with pressure boundary leakage. Therefore, the root cause of the pressure boundary leak path (weld solidification crack) not being detected during manufacture was less than adequate quality control inspection after manufacture of the flexible hose assemblies such that an extremely small pressure boundary defect was not detected by liquid penetrant and hydrostatic testing at 1.5 times design pressure (3750 psig) for 10 minutes.","['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"

While analyzing the cause, it was identified that two Engineering Change Packages (ECPs) were developed and implemented to replace the six dual-element RTDs during the Steam Generator Replacement Project (SGRP) in 2014. One ECP was written to support piping insulation removal and re-installation with a new, more effective insulation; and the second ECP was written to support RTD replacement. During comment resolution of the RTD ECP, the EQ Engineer provided comments and statements pertaining to insulation requirements that were not fully addressed and were not ultimately passed on to the engineer responsible for the piping insulation ECP. Additional individual errors were made during ECP development and work order along with post-implementation walkdown. Basic work practice weaknesses resulted in incorrect design development and implementation of the piping insulation for the RTD thermowells.
The direct cause of the RTD conductor wiring insulation degradation was accelerated aging due to high temperatures located at the RTD termination head. This wiring degradation was as a result of improper configuration of piping insulation on the RTD extension stem during the previous outage.
The apparent cause of the incorrect piping insulation configuration was due to incorrect and insufficient guidance provided in the piping insulation Engineering Change Package.

Step 4.6.5 of DB-OP- 06902 instructs the operator to verify ARTS is enabled prior to reaching 45 percent power. The direct cause for the ARTS Trip Bypass being left in bypass for SFRCS and Main Turbine during startup is the reactor operator failed to fully read and understand procedure DB-OP-06902 step 4.6.5 prior to verifying ARTS enabled at approximately 40 percent power. The operator did not preview/review the task/procedure before performance.
The root cause of this event is the operators failed to effectively work as a team to ensure a safety system was in an operable condition prior to the mode of applicability for plant startup. The operators were ineffective in their advocacy to understand why ARTS was in bypass and failed to get a critical review of assumptions they made that plant startup procedures would, at some point, restore ARTS.

The root cause for the failure to properly apply TS 3.3.5 was determined to be that station management failed to recognize in a timely manner that a normalized deviation in organizational behaviors has occurred surrounding the accountability for.critical performance standards and expectations. Additionally, organizational biases such as maintaining an unrealistic optimism towards an outcome, technical arrogance, overconfidence in knowledge and expertise, and the failure to seek or respond effectively to challenges, have resulted in the tendency to rationalize behaviors.","['leadership safety values and actions', 'personal accountability', 'problem identification and resolution']"

The direct cause of the generator lockout and subsequent reactor trip was rain falling through an open roof vent onto the Turbine deck, which migrated into the AVR through one or more of the cabinet's conduit connections.
The root causes of the generator lockout and reactor trip were (1) Operations Shift Managers did not advocate adequate and timely compensatory actions to eliminate the risk to generation posed by rain falling onto energized equipment through a stuck open Turbine Building roof vent, and (2) station management failed to recognize the roof vent rain issue as a potential imminent risk to generation. There are fourteen 4-foot by 8-foot smoke and heat vents in the Turbine Building roof, which are designed to automatically open at 165 degrees F due to a fusible link. Manual pull release handles also allow each vent to be opened without disturbing the fusible link.

The original plant design provided a single Diesel Oil Storage Tank [DE-TK] to provide fuel to the two individual EDG day tanks. This single, non-redundant tank was not missile protected or seismically qualified. The need for separate, redundant, seismic, and missile- protected fuel oil storage tanks to provide a seven-day fuel supply for each EDG was identified after initial plant construction had begun, but before the operating license had been issued. Design documents from original system design and construction state that,missile protection for the fuel oil storage tanks is provided by a mound of structural backfill covering both tanks. Although design drawings show the fuel oil storage tank vents penetrate the structural backfill, none of the documents reviewed consider the vents as potential missile targets or the effect of damaged vents on the operation of the tanks and EDGs.
A contributing cause to this event was that earlier compensatory measures proceduralized in procedure RA-EP-02810, Tornados or High Winds, were not properly vetted to ensure the EDGs would remain capable of performing their design function following a tornado. The potential for a fuel oil storage tank vent to be damaged during a tornado and challenge the EDG function was first identified in 2009. Compensatory actions were established to be performed after a tornado to ensure both fuel oil storage tanks had an adequate .vent path even if the normal vents were damaged. Those compensatory actions were later incorporated in procedure RA-EP-02810 to direct operators to inspect vulnerable missile targets following a tornado strike and establish an alternate vent path if the normal vent is damaged. However, to prevent physical damage to the tanks and transfer pumps that could result from operation without adequate venting, one of the procedure steps used to establish an alternate vent requires locking out the associated transfer pump and declaring the affected EDG train inoperable. This action is not aligned with the Technical Specifications, which requires the fuel transfer system to operate as designed. Moreover, the procedure does not include steps to restore the system to service for operability. While these procedure steps would prevent additional damage to the fuel oil storage tank, they do not ensure the fuel oil storage and transfer system remains fully functional during and after a tornado.

Davis-Besse,"The direct cause of the damaged AFW Pump Turbine 1 inboard bearing was due to operation with insufficient lubrication oil. The AFW Pump Turbine journal bearings are lubricated by slinger rings that ride on the turbine shaft located within the bearing assembly. During operation, the slinger rings rotate on the turbine shaft and rotate through the oil contained in the oil reservoir sump. The oil adheres to the slinger ring surfaces and is deposited on the turbine shaft near the bearing as the shaft rotates to provide bearing lubrication. During investigation and disassembly of the damaged inboard bearing, it was identified the existing oil level in the bearing was below the vendor recommended level, but was within the marked acceptable band of the oil level sight glass. The AFW Pump Turbine 1 inboard bearing oil sight glass operational band was marked too low to ensure proper bearing lubrication.
The root cause of the damaged AFW Pump Turbine 1 inboard bearing was that the preventive maintenance work instruction for replacing the sight glass did not include dimensions or guidance for setting required operational bands, and did not contain a requirement to reference the vendor manual to ensure the appropriate operational bands are established. The lack of detail in the work instruction resulted in Maintenance personnel setting the sight glass narrow operational band (minimum and maximum acceptable levels) via skill-of-the-craft when replacing the inboard bearing oil level sight glass.","['continuous learning', 'problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
Davis-Besse,The SFAS Channel 3 BWST Level Transmitter issue was determined to be caused by the transmitter reaching the end of its expected service life. The transmitter was determined to have been installed approximately 42 years ago during original plant construction.,"['problem identification and resolution', 'work processes']"
