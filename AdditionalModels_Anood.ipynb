      "The majority of the defective tubes detected in 2RE08 were the result of ODSCC at tube-to-tube support plate intersections. This tube degradation mechanism is well known to the industry (as documented in the EPRI Steam Generator Reference Book, Chapter 12) for plants employing drilled-hole tube support plates and Alloy 600 mill annealed tubes, and has been addressed in NRC Generic Letter 95-05. It is the result of tube susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in the tube support plate crevice environment as confirmed by tube pulls at South Texas Units 1 and 2 as well as at other plants, and by the UT results from this inspection. This stress corrosion cracking has been demonstrated to be a temperature-related corrosion process such that the higher the hot leg temperature, the more rapid the corrosion progression. The 2RE08 inspection results are consistent with this understanding of the ODSCC at tube support plate corrosion phenomenon in that the lower hot leg tube support plate intersections contain the majority of the axial indications found. The root causes of ODSCC at tube-to-tube support plate intersections may be summarized as the selection of tube material (Alloy 600 mill annealed) and the design of the tube-to-tube support plate intersection locations (crevices resulting from drilled holes). A contributing factor is the high reactor coolant system hot leg temperature design values. The remaining defective tubes were plugged primarily due to OD-initiated degradation. The cause of other OD-initiated degradation (primarily axial with some volumetric) is attributed to the tube material selection, and lack of care in handling tubing during manufacturing processes. For the circumferential indications at the hot leg top of tubesheet region, tube material selection in combination with residual stresses left by the tube expansion process are the primary causes. \n",

The report from the laboratory listed the cause for the diode failures as electrical overstress. The location of the melt sites on the two short circuited diodes indicate that one was most likely damaged by a reverse bias voltage transient and the other by a forward current transient. The cause for the electrical overstress cannot be determined. The control circuit was analyzed and found to be satisfactory. The diodes are rated at 10 amps and 600 volts, which is adequate for the circuit in which they are installed. The diodes are normally reverse biased at 125 volts direct current and the control circuit is fused at 3 amps. The root cause for the electrical overstress is unknown and considered to be a random failure. See Additional Information section for possible failure scenarios. \n",

      "The linkage mechanism that operates the breaker Y600 C phase pole failed due to a linkage connection pin falling out of the linkage. Inspection revealed that a bushing that is required between the linkage pin and the operating linkage was not installed. The bushing was most likely left out during fabrication.

      "The majority of the defective tubes detected in 2RE08 were the result of ODSCC at tube-to-tube support plate intersections. This tube degradation mechanism is well known to the industry (as documented in the EPRI Steam Generator Reference Book, Chapter 12) for plants employing drilled-hole tube support plates and Alloy 600 mill annealed tubes, and has been addressed in NRC Generic Letter 95-05. It is the result of tube susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in the tube support plate crevice environment as confirmed by tube pulls at South Texas Units 1 and 2 as well as at other plants, and by the UT results from this inspection. This stress corrosion cracking has been demonstrated to be a temperature-related corrosion process such that the higher the hot leg temperature, the more rapid the corrosion progression. The 2RE08 inspection results are consistent with this understanding of the ODSCC at tube support plate corrosion phenomenon in that the lower hot leg tube support plate intersections contain the majority of the axial indications found. The root causes of ODSCC at tube-to-tube support plate intersections may be summarized as the selection of tube material (Alloy 600 mill annealed) and the design of the tube-to-tube support plate intersection locations (crevices resulting from drilled holes). A contributing factor is the high reactor coolant system hot leg temperature design values. The remaining defective tubes were plugged primarily due to OD-initiated degradation. The cause of other OD-initiated degradation (primarily axial with some volumetric) is attributed to the tube material selection, and lack of care in handling tubing during manufacturing processes. For the circumferential indications at the hot leg top of tubesheet region, tube material selection in combination with residual stresses left by the tube expansion process are the primary causes. \n",

      "The cause of the unexpected closure of 2C FWIV was a shorted surge suppression device in the Class-1E control circuit.\n",
      "The suppression device contains four series parallel diodes and is actually a diode bridge. The diode bridge is used for surge suppression across the safety related trip solenoids. This short caused the fuse to blow in the control circuit, which de-energized the B-train safety solenoid. De-energizing the B-train solenoid dumps hydraulic fluid from the valve actuator allowing the FWIV to close.\n",
      "The failed diode bridge was sent off site for a laboratory failure analysis to determine the cause of the failure. The report from the laboratory listed the cause for the diode failures as electrical overstress. The location of the melt sites on the two short circuited diodes indicate that one was most likely damaged by a reverse bias voltage transient and the other by a forward current transient. The cause for the electrical overstress cannot be determined. The control circuit was analyzed and found to be satisfactory. The diodes are rated at 10 amps and 600 volts, which is adequate for the circuit in which they are installed. The diodes are normally reverse biased at 125 volts direct current and the control circuit is fused at 3 amps. The root cause for the electrical overstress is unknown and considered to be a random failure. See Additional Information section for possible failure scenarios. \n",

      "The majority of the defective tubes detected in 2RE08 were the result of ODSCC at tube-to-tube support plate intersections. This tube degradation mechanism is well known to the industry (as documented in the EPRI Steam Generator Reference Book, Chapter 12) for plants employing drilled-hole tube support plates and Alloy 600 mill annealed tubes, and has been addressed in NRC Generic Letter 95-05. It is the result of tube susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in the tube support plate crevice environment as confirmed by tube pulls at South Texas Units 1 and 2 as well as at other plants, and by the UT results from this inspection. This stress corrosion cracking has been demonstrated to be a temperature-related corrosion process such that the higher the hot leg temperature, the more rapid the corrosion progression. The 2RE08 inspection results are consistent with this understanding of the ODSCC at tube support plate corrosion phenomenon in that the lower hot leg tube support plate intersections contain the majority of the axial indications found. The root causes of ODSCC at tube-to-tube support plate intersections may be summarized as the selection of tube material (Alloy 600 mill annealed) and the design of the tube-to-tube support plate intersection locations (crevices resulting from drilled holes). A contributing factor is the high reactor coolant system hot leg temperature design values. The remaining defective tubes were plugged primarily due to OD-initiated degradation. The cause of other OD-initiated degradation (primarily axial with some volumetric) is attributed to the tube material selection, and lack of care in handling tubing during manufacturing processes. For the circumferential indications at the hot leg top of tubesheet region, tube material selection in combination with residual stresses left by the tube expansion process are the primary causes. \n",

      "The cause of the unexpected closure of 2C FWIV was a shorted surge suppression device in the Class-1E control circuit.\n",
      "The suppression device contains four series parallel diodes and is actually a diode bridge. The diode bridge is used for surge suppression across the safety related trip solenoids. This short caused the fuse to blow in the control circuit, which de-energized the B-train safety solenoid. De-energizing the B-train solenoid dumps hydraulic fluid from the valve actuator allowing the FWIV to close.\n",
      "The failed diode bridge was sent off site for a laboratory failure analysis to determine the cause of the failure. The report from the laboratory listed the cause for the diode failures as electrical overstress. The location of the melt sites on the two short circuited diodes indicate that one was most likely damaged by a reverse bias voltage transient and the other by a forward current transient. The cause for the electrical overstress cannot be determined. The control circuit was analyzed and found to be satisfactory. The diodes are rated at 10 amps and 600 volts, which is adequate for the circuit in which they are installed. The diodes are normally reverse biased at 125 volts direct current and the control circuit is fused at 3 amps. The root cause for the electrical overstress is unknown and considered to be a random failure. See Additional Information section for possible failure scenarios. \n",
