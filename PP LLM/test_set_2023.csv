"DCPP’s examination of this issue in its Root Cause Evaluation (RCE) was extensive and detailed, and included reviews of operating experience within the industry. The examination concluded that DCPP lacked clear standards for risk assessment, risk evaluations, and risk mitigation activities that could, and did, result in SSFFs. It further concluded that, when reviewing evaluations, the station had a tendency to justify and accept the evaluations rather than to provide a healthy challenge to them. It also noted that opportunities had been missed to reinforce high standards, that resolutions of identified risks were sometimes incomplete, and that there was sometimes no means or expectation for identifying risk significant activities. A contributing cause identified by the station was that “station personnel had insufficient understanding of the definition of an SSFF, resulting in failure to recognize that adherence to station procedures and plant Technical Specification action requirements does not prevent SSFFs.",continuous learning,problem identification and resolution,questioning attitude,personal accountability

"The DCPP Fuel Handling System has been problematic since Refueling Outage 2R14. Problems have been mostly due to age-related issues and lack of adequate inspection, maintenance, and component replacement, especially electrical contacts. Interim corrective actions are to be employed until Refueling Outage 1R19, when major modifications to the system will begin; and the interim corrective actions appeared satisfactory. DCPP responded properly to the failure of the shaft seals in its Unit 1 and Unit 2 Reactor Coolant Pumps in Outages 1R18 and 2R17 respectively by replacing most seal parts and initiating a Root Cause Evaluation, and the evaluations appeared to be comprehensive and accurate. The options being examined and pursued by both DCPP and PG&E’s transmission group appear to provide satisfactory remedies to the issue of voltage fluctuations on the 230kV system. Equipment problems and failures increased the frequency of Critical Event Clock Resets in the second half of 2013. Also, equipment problems due to aging have led to an increasingly negative trend in the station’s Deficient Critical Component Backlog Orders.

In response to these four issues, the station has developed an extensive site-wide program whose apparent objective is to ensure that no mistakes will ever occur.

"The Design Quality issue is about erroneous designs released for construction. During Refueling Outage 1R17, there were major modification designs released for implementation which had errors. The reason for the error determination was the large number of Field Changes required for the modifications to be implemented. Three design packages were issued incomplete (“managed exceptions”) due to vendor issues and late scope additions, counting on the Field Change Process (FCP) to add information to complete the packages; however, the FCP did not include the same discipline and rigor as the full Design Change Process (DCP). Approximately one-third of the FCs were required due to design errors. Adding to the problem was the fact that each of these designs was begun late and performed on a compressed time schedule. ",work processes,personal accountability,,
"DCPP had investigated the design quality problems and developed a plan of corrective action, which included, in addition to tighter controls of Field Changes, improved project communications, augmented pre-release design reviews, and additional training of engineers on the design change process.

This ultimately created an environment that promulgated a human error-likely environment.” More specifically, the RCE team determined that the environment consisted of poor communication, lack of engineering leadership, too much reliance on vendor designs, time pressure, and distractions.",leadership safety values and actions,effective safety communication,work processes,respectful work environment

The apparent cause was identified as “ . . . age-related degradation of Spent Fuel Pool bridge crane controllers exacerbated by limited margin of the current 24-Volt control systems.” The three 2R17 events all involved contacts in the 24 Volt systems, which have little margin for degraded (dirty) contacts. Other failures were due to lack of or inadequate regular inspections, maintenance (cleaning) or replacement and due to lack of a thorough understanding by operators of the infrequently used system. These problems did not adversely affect nuclear safety but mostly contributed to delays in fuel movement.",work processes,problem identification and resolution,continuous learning,questioning attitude

DCPP maintains a higher number of inactive Licensed Operators (approximately 20) than is typical in order to maintain a reserve pool of off-shift operators as the plant approaches the cessation of power operations. The DCISC considered this an excellent approach to reduce the risk of dropping below the required number of Licensed Operators due to unexpected operator losses. Inactive license holders were still required to participate fully in all training weeks.
