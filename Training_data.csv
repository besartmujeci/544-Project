3462002008.pdf,Davis-Besse,"Following unit shutdown on February 16, 2002, various degraded conditions were identified associated with the CACs which were documented in condition reports (CRs). The issues were related to structural integrity (seismic adequacy, boric acid corrosion, and post accident thermal stress); maintenance, test, and configuration control; thermal performance; and 10 CFR 21 reports.",problem_identification,work_processes,questioning_attitude,,,,
2752012003.pdf,Diablo Canyon,Electrical Maintenance (EM) supervisors have not consistently reinforced self-checking standards.,leadership_values,safety_communication,personal_accountability,,,,
2752013003.pdf,Diablo Canyon,"Degraded insulation, contamination, and weather issues caused the insulation flash-over.",questioning_attitude,problem_identification,environment_raising_concerns,,,,
2752000005.pdf,Diablo Canyon,"The shift foreman did not review the TS prior to directing the operators to
close the accumulator isolation valve breakers. He believed that TS
3.5.1a required only that the valves be open and did not recognize that the accumulators would be considered inoperable with the breakers
closed.",personal_accountability,work_processes,continuous_learning,safety_communication,,,
4982002001.pdf,South Texas,Verbal communications between Control Room personnel and Systems Engineering personnel lacked sufficient process rigor to ensure that a common understanding of the problem was achieved. Knowledge issues related to CRE failure modes and suitable compensatory actions to maintain system operability concerns contributed to the communications failure.,safety_communication,environment_raising_concerns,continuous_learning,,,,
4982000002.pdf,South Texas,"On February 14, 1995, Technical Specifications 3.8.2.2 and 3.8.3.2 were amended. The new Technical Specifications did not provide a listing of specific equipment required to be OPERABLE in Modes 5 and 6 for support equipment, as was in the previous Technical Specifications. No additional administrative instructions or controls were put in place to ensure proper implementation.",safety_communication,work_processes,leadership_values,,,,
2752015002.pdf,Diablo Canyon,"PG&E completed an ACE and determined that the cause of the failures was insufficient guidance in the work package instructions which led to an incorrect insulation configuration on the wiring associated with the RTDs. The insulation configuration as installed trapped heat inside the thermal extension piping that housed the wiring associated with the RTDs. The wires overheated inside the thermal extension piping, which caused the failures. As part of the extent of condition evaluation for the failed RTDs, it was determined that the RTDs had either failed or were operating outside the EQ temperature range.",questioning_attitude,continuous_learning,,,,,
3461999003.pdf,Davis-Besse,The cause of this event was determined to be inadequate procedural guidance during cooldown. Required reading was provided to operators concerning the evaluation of the event. The procedure for cooling down the reactor coolant system and the pressurizer was modified to provide the necessary information.,decision_making,leadership_values,safety_communication,work_processes,,,
3462000004.pdf,Davis-Besse,"The electrician checking the status of the lockout relays mistakenly checked the relays on the wrong side of the electrical panel, which were for the main generator instead of Startup Transformer 02. While checking the status of the relays, a main generator protection relay was actuated, which locked out the only available offsite AC power source, resulting in the loss of offsite power.",personal_accountability,decision_making,work_processes,,,,
4982000005.pdf,South Texas,The root cause of this event was the lack of questioning attitude by the Reactor Operator and the Unit Supervisor to validate qualification concerns. A contributing cause was an informal process was used to distribute the active license list to the control rooms.,questioning_attitude,safety_communication,work_processes,,,,
2752013004.pdf,Diablo Canyon,"Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) determined the cause of this event was an inattentive error by control room operators who placed all EDGs in manual before returning the selector switch to auto. Additionally, the Shift Foreman did not provide oversight as required by plant procedures and the annunciator response procedure did not contain any caution or note to prevent operators from using manual control to shut down all three EDGs concurrently.",personal_accountability,leadership_values,work_processes,,,,
2752011006.pdf,Diablo Canyon,The cause was human error by the work control shift foreman when he prematurely authorized removal of the blank flange prior to all work being complete. Insufficient controls existed to assure that the CRE integrity was maintained during maintenance.,personal_accountability,questioning_attitude,,,,,
4992013004.pdf,South Texas,"The cause of the event was unspecific guidance in the off normal procedure for secondary plant stabilization. The urgency in this event was not from a design basis accident but from a need to protect major plant equipment. The failure of the bearing oil lift piping placed the Control Room Staff in a situation that required prompt action to prevent equipment damage, and the Staff made a decision to use the MSI Actuation switch as a result of the unspecific written guidance to ensure MSIVs and Main Steam Isolation Bypass valves (MSIBs) are closed.",safety_communication,work_processes,leadership_values,,,,
3462002003.pdf,Davis-Besse,"With the doors open and no designated individual immediately available outside the personnel air lock, the Limiting Conditions for Operation for TS 3.9.4 and TS 3.9.12 were no longer satisfied. The Action Requirement for TS 3.9.4 was met because core alterations in Containment had been suspended.",decision_making,,,,,,
4992000001.pdf,South Texas,"The event was caused by a modification that introduced reduced operating margin into the AMSAC design. The modification reduced the arming setpoint for turbine impulse pressure from 40% to 30%, and in doing so created a corresponding reduction in the operating margin. Consequently, a system intended to provide protection against abnormal deviations of reactor power and feedwater flow actuated under plant conditions that were normal for power ascension.",decision_making,,,,Nikki,Vijay,LGTM
