## Worked on the following additional models (in "AdditionalModels_Anood.ipynb")

### 1. Zero-shot MLC, with traits descriptions in prompt, no training
### 2. Random classifier, trivial baseline classifier that randomly picks an output label, with equal probabilities.
### 3. Few-shot MLC, with trais descriptions in prompt, and with training
