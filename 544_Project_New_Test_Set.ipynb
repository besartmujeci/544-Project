            "The DCISC observed a December 7, 2021, licensed operator simulator scenario for a crew comprised of Licensed Operators the majority of whom were currently working in off-shift positions. Most of the crew's licenses were currently inactive; meaning, they did not regularly work the minimum number of on-shift hours necessary to maintain their licenses in active status. DCPP maintains a higher number of inactive Licensed Operators (approximately 20) than is typical in order to maintain a reserve pool of off-shift operators as the plant approaches the cessation of power operations. The DCISC considered this an excellent approach to reduce the risk of dropping below the required number of Licensed Operators due to unexpected operator losses. Inactive license holders were still required to participate fully in all training weeks. The simulator scenario was designed to evaluate crew performance in any or all areas and was not tied to any particular course of instruction. This scenario was similar to one which would be performed during the operating portion of a formal initial license or requalification examination.\n",

It further concluded that, when reviewing evaluations, the station had a tendency to justify and accept the evaluations rather than to provide a healthy challenge to them. It also noted that opportunities had been missed to reinforce high standards, that resolutions of identified risks were sometimes incomplete, and that there was sometimes no means or expectation for identifying risk significant activities.

            "The DCPP Fuel Handling System has been problematic since Refueling Outage 2R14. Problems have been mostly due to age-related issues and lack of adequate inspection, maintenance, and component replacement, especially electrical contacts. Interim corrective actions are to be employed until Refueling Outage 1R19, when major modifications to the system will begin; and the interim corrective actions appeared satisfactory. DCPP responded properly to the failure of the shaft seals in its Unit 1 and Unit 2 Reactor Coolant Pumps in Outages 1R18 and 2R17 respectively by replacing most seal parts and initiating a Root Cause Evaluation, and the evaluations appeared to be comprehensive and accurate. The options being examined and pursued by both DCPP and PG&E’s transmission group appear to provide satisfactory remedies to the issue of voltage fluctuations on the 230kV system. Equipment problems and failures increased the frequency of Critical Event Clock Resets in the second half of 2013. Also, equipment problems due to aging have led to an increasingly negative trend in the station’s Deficient Critical Component Backlog Orders. DCPP’s performance on reducing or eliminating Safety System Functional Failures (SSFFs) has not improved despite implementation of a corrective action plan. DCPP’s Root Cause Evaluation of Unit 2’s trip from 100 percent power following a failure on the 500kV Main Bank Transformer B phase lightning arrester is extensive and appears to be reasonable.\n",
